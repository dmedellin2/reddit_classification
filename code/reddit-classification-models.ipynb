    "\n",
    "NBC is looking to see how people engage with some of their most famous sitcoms on various social media platforms. One of these platforms is Reddit. An intern at NBC was tasked with gathering as many submissions as he could from subreddits for NBC sitcoms like _Will & Grace, The Office, Parks and Recreation, Brooklyn 99_, and _The Good Place_. Unfortunately, this intern was terrible at organization and dumped all of the posts he found into one general folder. NBC has been working to properly separate all of the submissions into their proper TV show groups. Most of the submissions were able to be separated, but two shows remain: _The Office_ and _Parks and Recreation_.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It is so difficult to separate the posts between these two shows because they share a lot of similarities. For starters, they share some of the same creators including Greg Daniels and Michael Schur. Both shows are considered workplace comedies as they take place at either a paper company or a government office. While both shows started and ended in different years, they had many years of overlap where both were actively on the air. Additionally, the two shows share some character names and even an actor! For example, both shows include a character named 'Andy' and Rashida Jones played a consistent role in both TV shows. Looking at crossover between character names and actor names, we get even more commonalities, for example the character 'Michael Scott' from _The Office_ and the actor Adam Scott, who plays a main role in _Parks and Recreation_.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the many similarities between these two shows, NBC came to us to help them sort through the posts and separate them back into their appropriate subreddits: _The Office_ -- r/DunderMifflin, and _Parks and Recreation_ -- r/PandR.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, NBC is also interested in what content helped made it possible to differentiate between the two shows and what Reddit users are talking about the most in each of the subreddits.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will build a classification model that will help to sort each post to its appropriate subreddit. Our model's success will be measured with an accuracy score."

Looking at the quartlies and maximum for the `num_comments` column, it appears that there may be outliers in the data since the maximum is so far from the 75th percentile. Similarly, for the `score` column, the range from the minimum to the 75th percentile is 0 - 10, but the jump from the 75th percentile to the maximum is much greater with a maximum of 22726. Again, this shows that there may be outliers in the data. "

The two subreddits have similar distributions with peaks around 2016-2017. These are years that both of the shows were already off air. Neither subreddit seems to fall below 100 posts in a specific time range. Surprisingly, the most recent time range has a similar amount of posts as the first time range. Both subreddits show a similar distribution meaning using the `timestamp` feature might not be useful for our model. "

    "Above are the top 30 most frequently used words found in both subreddits combined. Most of these words are general filler words that do not give us much meaning like `the`, `of`, and `with`. Some of them make sense given that our two subreddits are focused on television shows, like `episode`, `show`, and `season`. Only two of these words stick out to us as being possibly important words that could help determine which subreddit a post is from: `office` and `michael`. The reason for that is because the r/DunderMifflin subreddit is about the show _The Office_ and the main character of that show is Michael Scott. Given these facts it is expected that the words `office` and `michael` would show up frequently in the posts of that subreddit. "

    "\n",
    "We separated out the **unique** words for each subreddit's top 30 and plotted their frequencies above. Still there are some words that don't give us much information such as `your`, `do`, `from`, `my`, `can`, and `how`, but we also notice some other words that stand out. For the _The Office_ subreddit some of the top words include `office`, `michael`, `pam`, `jim`, and `dwight`. While `office` may seem like a mundane word, it is very important for the r/DunderMifflin subreddit because it is the name of the show that the subreddit is focused on, _The Office_! Additionally, four of the main characters of the show are Jim, Michael, Pam, and Dwight, so these are definitely bound to pop up in r/DunderMifflin posts more often than the other subreddit.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, for r/PandR, which focuses on the show _Parks and Recreation_ (often abbreviated as _Parks and Rec_), two of the most popular words are `parks` and `rec`. The second and third most popular unique words are `ron` and `leslie`, which are two main characters of the TV show. It makes sense that these two words would show up often in posts from r/PandR. "

Many of the words that remained were names of characters or locations where the shows take place. Some additional words that were kept despite seeming random were `christmas`, `little`, and `day`. The reasons for these are because in _The Office_ they have a lot of Christmas episodes that are pretty notorious in the fandom. _The Office_ also has an entire episode focused on 'Pretzel Day', so this might be discussed in the r/DunderMifflin subreddit. Lastly, `little` was kept because there is a character in _Parks and Recreation_ who is a small horse and his name is Little Sebastian.

    "Looking at the training and testing accuracy scores as well as the differences between those scores for all of our models helps us determine which model to use. Looking at strictly accuracy of the testing score, the Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine models are performing the best, all with a score above 78%. It is important to consider the difference between the training and testing scores, though, for these models. The Logistic Regression model, despite showing the best testing score, also has the largest difference in scores of the top 3. The Support Vector Machine model has a smaller difference than the Logistic Regression model. The model with the smallest difference between training and testing scores, though, is the Multinomial Naive Bayes model. It also happens to be our second best performing model on the test data. For this reason, **we will choose the Multinomial Naive Bayes model as our best model for making predictions.**   \n",

Many of the above posts mention Andy and no other identifying characters or features of the show, which is why the model had trouble determining its appropriate subreddit. One title that doesn't quite fit this logic is the one that reads _'Does anybody else think that when Andy becomes manager, the writers just wrote his lines as though he was Michael Scott?'_ Michael Scott is the main character of _The Office_ so we would assume this combination would have helped the model to determine the appropriate subreddit, but alas it did not.

    "The submission with the title _'Is it just me or does John Krasinski (Jimmy Halpert) voice a lot of commercials?'_ was misclassified, which is surprising to me. Not only does this have a character name, but it also has the actor's name as well! John Krasinski plays one of the main characters, Jim Halpert, on _The Office_. It is interesting that this submission somehow made it into the r/PandR predictions. Similarly, the post with the title _'I think Kevin was the person who robbed the office in the Crime Aid episode.'_ was also predicted to be in r/PandR despite having a fairly popular character in the title as well as the name of the show, _The Office_.

    "Above are the top 15 positive coefficients for the logistic regression model. When we look at the list, it makes sense. Ron, Leslie, Jerry, April, Ben, Ann, Chris, Mark, Donna, Tom, and Tammy are all main characters from _Parks and Recreation_. Pawnee is the town where _Parks and Recreation_ takes place. `PandR` is the name of the subreddit itself. Lastly, `amp` may seem odd here, but actually this makes sense as well. Often, people write the name of the show as _Parks & Rec_, using an ampersand. In HTML, the `&` sign is read as `&amp;`. So when we read in this data from reddit, it pulled in `&amp;` as opposed to `&` and our model cleaned the non-alphanumeric symbols from the word, leaving only `amp`. "

    "Above are the 15 strongest negative coefficients for the logistic regression model. For the most part, this list makes sense. Michael, Dwight, Pam, Jim, Toby, Creed, Ryan, Angela, Erin, and Darryl are all main characters on the show _The Office_. Scranton is where _The Office_ takes place. The word `office` makes sense, as it is in the name of the show. `dundermifflin` is not only the name of the subreddit we are discussing, but it is also the name of the paper company that _The Office_ focuses on. It isn't exactly clear why `room` is an indicator of being a part of the r/DunderMifflin subreddit, but we can assume it might have something to do with _the conference room_ and the fact that Michael is always hosting strange meetings in there. This might pop up in some submissions then. Lastly, `best episode` is an interesting feature. This could obviously apply to either show/subreddit, but apparently was discussed more in the r/DunderMifflin subreddit. "
