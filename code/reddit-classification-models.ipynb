    "NBC is looking to see how people engage with some of their most famous sitcoms on various social media platforms. One of these platforms is Reddit. An intern at NBC was tasked with gathering as many posts as he could from subreddits for NBC sitcoms like _Will & Grace, The Office, Parks and Recreation, Brooklyn 99_, and _The Good Place_. Unfortunately, this intern was terrible at organization and dumped all of the posts he found into one general folder. NBC has been working to properly separate all of the posts into their TV show groups. Most of the posts were able to be separated, but two shows remain: _The Office_ and _Parks and Recreation_.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It is so difficult to separate the posts between these two shows because they share a lot of similarities. For starters, they share some of the same creators including Greg Daniels and Michael Schur. Both shows are considered workplace comedies as they take place at either a paper company or a government office. While both shows started and ended in different years, they had many years of overlap where both were actively on the air. Additionally, the two shows share some character names and even an actor! For example, both shows include a character named 'Andy' and Rashida Jones played a consistent role in both TV shows. Looking at crossover between character names and actor names, we get even more commonalities, for example the character 'Michael Scott' from _The Office_ and the actor Adam Scott, who plays a main role in _Parks and Recreation_.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the many similarities between these two shows, NBC came to us to help them sort through the posts and separate them back into their appropriate subreddits: _The Office_ -- r/DunderMifflin, and _Parks and Recreation_ -- r/PandR.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, NBC is also interested in what content helped made it possible to differentiate between the two shows and what Reddit users are talking about the most in each of the subreddits.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will build a classification model that will help to sort each post to its appropriate subreddit. Our model's success will be measured with an accuracy score."

    "Statistics for the `subreddit` column make sense as the max is 1 and the min is 0. Looking at the quartlies and maximum for the `num_comments` column, it appears that there may be outliers in the data since the maximum is so far from the 75th percentile. Similarly, for the `score` column, the range from the minimum to the 75th percentile is 0 - 10, but the jump from the 75th percentile to the maximum is much greater with a maximum of 22726. Again, this shows that there may be outliers in the data. "

The two subreddits have similar distributions with peaks around 2016-2017. These are years that both of the shows were already off air. Neither subreddit seems to fall below 100 posts in a specific time range. Surprisingly, the most recent time range has a similar amount of posts as the first time range. Both subreddits show a similar distribution meaning using the `timestamp` feature might not be useful for our model. "

    "Above are the top 30 most frequently used words found in both subreddits combined. Most of these words are general filler words that do not give us much meaning like `the`, `of`, and `with`. Some of them make sense given that our two subreddits are focused on television shows, like `episode`, `show`, and `season`. Only two of these words stick out to us as being possibly important words that could help determine which subreddit a post is from: `office` and `michael`. The reason for that is because the r/DunderMifflin subreddit is about the show _The Office_ and the main character of that show is Michael Scott. Given these facts it is expected that the words `office` and `michael` would show up frequently in the posts of that subreddit. "

    "\n",
    "We separated out the **unique** words for each subreddit's top 30 and plotted their frequencies above. Still there are some words that don't give us much information such as `your`, `do`, `from`, `my`, `can`, and `how`, but we also notice some other words that stand out. For the _The Office_ subreddit some of the top words include `office`, `michael`, `pam`, `jim`, and `dwight`. While `office` may seem like a mundane word, it is very important for the r/DunderMifflin subreddit because it is the name of the show that the subreddit is focused on, _The Office_! Additionally, four of the main characters of the show are Jim, Michael, Pam, and Dwight, so these are definitely bound to pop up in r/DunderMifflin posts more often than the other subreddit.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, for r/PandR, which focuses on the show _Parks and Recreation_ (often abbreviated as _Parks and Rec_), two of the most popular words are `parks` and `rec`. The second and third most popular unique words are `ron` and `leslie`, which are two main characters of the TV show. It makes sense that these two words would show up often in posts from r/PandR. "
