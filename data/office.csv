The Chair Model 4:10 Important Discussion,"Hi all.  In this episode Dwight calls the modeling agency about the whereabouts of the chair model in the magazine.  The modeling agency declares her dead to Dwight, which had me thinking.

Did they give out a random name of a dead person in order to stop Dwight (who was assumed to be a stalker and dangerous to the model) from pursuing her?

Or do you think she actually died in the fictional script she lived in?

Side note - One of the best lines of the whole series is when Michael and Dwight are in the graveyard discussing the woman's demise and Michael goes 'You know, I used to think that I had this perfect person out there waiting for me.

"Shower Thought: Michael ended up using Toby's strategy for conflict resolution, by telling Dwight that he would address the other ""400 complaints"" later in the week.","In Season 2, Episode 21: Conflict Resolution, Michael seeks to resolve a series of complaints that the employees have filed against each other with Toby. In the famous conflict resolution sub plot where several of Jim's pranks on Dwight are read, Dwight demands that Michael fire Jim for said pranks. 

In the end, Michael knowing that he should not do that for a variety of reasons tells Dwight that he will look into that later in the week. Thus using Toby's strategy of letting people vent their problems and frustrations to him in the Break Room. Exact Strategy: 

""Michael, can I talk to you for a second, please? Yes.
Here's how I usually handle this.
All I do is listen, you know? These things just have a way of working themselves out.

Jim really isn‚Äôt that special or smart,"So I‚Äôm watching around season 4 of the Office, and I have noticed recently that Jim really isn‚Äôt that intelligent of a guy, is quite awkward and has horrible social skills.

Also when he gets Hanks phone number he‚Äôs so fucking awkward trying to identify him it hurts me. Oh and giving Ryan critique on Dunder Mifflin infinity, he goes over Ryan‚Äôs head, then acts like a pussy when Ryan confronts him over it. 
Just kind of shows me that Dunder Mifflin continues to be horrible at choosing employees to promote, and they‚Äôre a typical, old-fashioned and dying corporation. Jim is literally just tall, slightly arrogant which gives the impression of confidence and David Wallace is grooming him. Same thing with Michael, he‚Äôs a lovable dumbass who had an excellent sales record so they promoted him.

Interesting Insight into Casino Night,"I'm sure others have thought of this before, but it just came to me the other day. I'm wondering how many others have thought of this, and if ya'll have any more to add:

When Pam and Jim, are playing cards, she tells him that she‚Äôs going to take him all in. Coincidentally, this sort of foreshadows the coming moment when Jim does, in fact, go all in and tell Pam about his feelings for her. Additionally, Jim seemingly has a good hand to go all in with (three 9‚Äôs). However, it‚Äôs not a strong enough hand to take the win. Likewise, Jim seemingly has a good connection with Pam, but he misreads Pam in real life in thinking that she‚Äôd break it off with Roy to be with him.  

Another point about the game is that Jim apparently put in for a transfer before all of this happened. And at the time of the poker night, Jan sort of lets on that he‚Äôs getting close to transferring to Stamford. Jim realizes that this means he‚Äôs running out of time to tell Pam how he feels, and this is sort of paralleled in the *amount of chips he has*. Jim goes all in, but he‚Äôs also low on chips to begin with. He‚Äôs sort of at that point where you have to go all in or lose any chance of staying in the game. So in a sense, the chips represent the time that's running out before he has to transfer to Stamford.",DunderMifflin,1571469698,spagheddie,4,9,True,2019-10-19

 The most obvious one, when Jim and Pam to to the daycare and Pam claims that they're really nice people, when they were honestly being pretty pushy and assuming that they would get in. 

Also, when Danny Cordray calls Pam dorky, she can't even use words and just starts making noises after pestering the guy all day about why he didn't call her back.

I love when Michael is stern.,"As much as I love it to see Micheal as a real competent person - like when he excels as a salesman - I really enjoy when Michael is very stern and serious. It's rare and I can only think of two incidences but they're kind of effective to me. The first is of course ""Did I Stutter"" when he yells everyone to leave so he can talk to Stanley. He then, after a short cry, tells Stanley he needs to treat him with respect because he is still his boss. I love that scene because it really brings characterization to Michael and shows how competent he really is. 
The second example is in ""Business Ethics"" when he yells at everyone to get in the conference room to listen to the rest of Holly's presentation. It not only shows his capability to demand his employees but also his devotion to Holly.

"Season 5 vs Season 6: Why doesn't the office seem sad when Michael leaves to start his paper company in S5, but in S6 they are devastated Michael is leaving with Holly?","I was just rewatching The Office series for the 100th time and it kind of bothers me what a radical change in the office atmosphere there was in season 5 versus season 6, was it purely at the discretion of the writers for the plot and Steve leaving? Or did significant events really happen to further bond Michael with the rest of the office?

When Michael Scott leaves Dunder Mifflin to start his own paper company in Season 5, nobody seems particularly upset that Michael is gone, actually many people seem happy / relieved. Pam doesn't necessarily go with him because she is so sad to see him go or because she misses him so dearly yet, just because she wants a chance to do more than be a receptionist. 

Yet in season 6 when Michael is with Holly and they plan to move to Colorado together, the office is devastated at the thought of losing Michael. Michael has become more than a boss/bully/comedian and a dear friend to everyone in the office and is really loved. I know in a way he always was but the change from S5 to S6 seems drastic. Did the writers only do this because Steve would be leaving or because something really happened in this period? it just bugs me the 180 here.",DunderMifflin,1555905117,wunderwunder2,7,7,True,2019-04-21

Introduced a bunch of side characters I didn't like and got rid of 3 of my favorites (Kelly, Ryan and Gabe).

This is a weird gripe but I felt like it took them a bit too long for Pam and Jim to start having relationship problems, I kinda grew bored of Jim and Pam, once they got together they didn't really develop their relationship further and only decided in the final season to try and spice it up. Felt like it would have been more appropriate last season, especially with the coworker coming on to Jim. 

While it was interesting to see the camera crew, they didn't really explore their relationship with the office group as much as I was hoping.

Laughter black magic,"I started watching the office right after it aired and I've never stopped.  It's a huge comfort for me and I like having it on either when I'm getting other stuff done or just to watch the episodes. One thing that my roommate doesn't get is how I still crack up laughing when I watch it.  I almost never rewatch other stuff, but somehow every time I rewatch the office I find more stuff that makes me laugh out loud. I'm sure this happens to a lot of people, but what do you think it is about the show? Just that there are so many episodes? Or your humor has changed over time so you find new stuff funny? Or is it just a magical show that I need not question?  ",DunderMifflin,1540271050,scotts-tots69,3,1,True,2018-10-23

Michael inadvertently saved Stanley‚Äôs life in season 4,"I‚Äôm new this sub, so forgive me if this has been mentioned before, but without knowing it, Michael saved Stanley‚Äôs life in S4:E7/8 ‚ÄúMoney.‚Äù When Michael called Stanley to sell the diet pills, Stanley recognized Michael‚Äôs voice and instantly shut Michael down from selling him the diet pills. Had someone else called Stanley, he may have bought the diet pills in order to lose weight, and had his heart attack sooner than he did. 

We know that Stanley was, as Dwight so elegantly put it, ‚Äúfilled him full of butter and sugar for 50 years and forced him not to exercise,‚Äù and had underlying heart disease. Given Michael was selling ‚ÄúLipo-phederine‚Äù diet pills, this could have exacerbated Stanley‚Äôs underlying coronary artery disease and caused him to have a worse heart attack than he did, potentially disabling or killing Stanley. I guess he is lucky it was Michael who called and bugged him while he was home and not someone else.

S3:12 Traveling Salesmen is one of the best episodes ever!,"Ok, gonna be real honest here, I just had about 100 ml of Bulleit Rye, but this episode is one of the best ever in terms of characters and specifically Michael Scott as both salesman and manager.  One of the most interesting things in this episode to me is seeing Michael reacting to Andy criticizing Dwight while simultaneously losing a sale.  

We see Andy‚Äôs tactics to get ahead, undermining Dwight  while screwing up Michael‚Äôs sale‚Äôs pitch, then saying that screwing up big time is something Dwight would do.  He repeatedly mentions how Dwight was late, although Dwight‚Äôs been late (to my knowledge) two times.  Once because of getting the day wrong (Jim Prank) and today because he ran the tax documents to corporate for Angela.

Probably my two favorite moments on this watch through were when Andy after blowing the sale asks, ‚ÄúDo we even want that guy buying our paper?‚Äù  And Michael replies firmly,  but not harshly, ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù  and then when Michal confronts Dwight he doesn‚Äôt instantly go crazy throwing blame at Dwight or saying that he went behind his back, he simply asks Dwight to tell him what he was doing at corporate that morning.

Throughout the episode we also have lots of interesting interactions between characters: Jim and Dwight, Pam and Angela, Michael and Andy, Dwight and Angela, Jim and Karen, Karen and Phyllis Stanley and Ryan, etc.  It was awesome to see Karen find out about Jim‚Äôs crush on Pam, and then talk to him in a reasonable manner!  This is not something we see often in TV!!!

Dwight and Jim closed a difficult sale (the client clearly wanted to save money at first, then capitulated based on customer service) while Andy and Michael failed to close an easy sale, despite Michael being an awesome salesmen, (customer clearly wanted to work with a small company, had had troubles with large companies in the past) because Andy kept insisting that they were a big awesome company.

Then Dwight voluntarily leaves, despite saving the branch‚Äôs ass by both delivering important documents and closing a difficult sale, just so that Angela wouldn‚Äôt get hurt.

Also, we get an amazing Dwight-Jim hug!!!

I know this is rambling and not well organized, but I just love this episode!!!

Why Toby might actually be the key to Michaels happiness,"I‚Äôm doing a rewatch (aren‚Äôt we all) and I just finished Take Your Daughter to Work Day. Hilarious episode, but it struck me in a new way this time around. At the beginning Michael says to the camera ‚Äúit‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt like kids, but why be a dad when you can be a fun uncle?‚Äù It‚Äôs an insight into Michaels attitude toward children in his late 30s, early 40s, that he doesn‚Äôt really have an interest in having kids. Then there‚Äôs the part of the episode where Toby‚Äôs daughter Sasha comes into his office. Michael is taken aback at first, he just kinda stares at her for a minute. Then he begins to talk to her, he jokes and lets her play with his desk toys. When Toby is leaving at the end of the day he returns several toys Sasha took, and Michael offers to give them to her. From this point on, Michael shows over and over again his newfound love for kids, and expresses his desire to be a father. His dating profile, LittleKidLover, the fact that he is ‚Äúdeliriously happy‚Äù when he thinks Jan‚Äôs child is his, not to mention his obsession with being a father to said unborn baby (until he holds Astird and feels ‚Äúnothing‚Äù) are all evidence of this. If Toby hadn‚Äôt brought his daughter into work, and had Michael not spent time with her, Michael may never have become interested in having a family, potentially leading him to an unhappy future as we can see Michael is pretty happy to have children in the last episode. Maybe this isn‚Äôt as concrete as I think or I‚Äôm simply interpreting things the wrong way, but it seems to me that Toby bringing Sasha to the office may have fundamentally changed Michael Scott as a person and for the better.",DunderMifflin,1524776445,the_weary_knight,14,73,True,2018-04-26

I Just Finished The Series And... Wow,"I'm just so happy \(and a little sad\). The Office started for me as a kind of 'dumb comedy show"" to watch when I was down. I think it was the Jim and Pam Arc that really changed my mind, and after that I couldn't stop watching. The only time I think I took a break that didn't involve things like food and drink was Goodbye, Micheal. I watch a lot of television, movies, the works, but I have to say for a ""dumb comedy"" this episode hit me hard. I couldn't press continue, I couldn't binge anymore, I could barely even move. I was just genuinely sad. For as many times in the series I thought ""Uh, somebody just punch this guy in the face!"" when it came to Micheal, I'd do anything for another episode of his cringey nonsense. Finale was the biggest blow by far though. So many shows create these overwhelming, massive plots, and by the end they can't keep up, but just everything felt so right.

What are your favorite moments from Season 1?,"My friends and I were talking about The Office this weekend, which is collectively our favorite show. As we laughed and reminisced about our favorite moments, I realized how few of them came from Season 1. Season 1 isn't my favorite season by far, but I've got to give credit where credit is due. It was the introduction to the cooky paper company nestled in sleepy Scranton, PA, and set the scene for what would be one of the best series in television history. 

So, I'm just curious; what are some of your favorite moments that happened in Season 1?

For me, it has to be the entire ""Basketball"" episode. This is the very first episode that I can remember laughing out loud to. From Michael cheering on Stanley, the ""secret weapon"", only to realize he's not that great, to Kevin sinking every shot he takes. Season 1 is overall a bit drier than the following seasons, as the show just hadn't found its footing yet, but S1:E5 honestly might be one of my favorite episodes in the entire series.",DunderMifflin,1509289711,bakedpotatowcheezpls,8,9,True,2017-10-29

A little discouraged after finishing season 3 for the first time.,"I had some trouble with getting started, but a little ways into season 2 I actually started to like the show. Why I stuck it out that long, I don't know, but I'm glad I did, because season three was aweso..

and then the last two episodes hit, and I'm back to being annoyed with the show. Before you go comment and downvote and such, please read on. I know I am coming onto a sub full of people who are crazy about this show and criticizing it, but since I really started to get into this show, it makes me really sad at how it went downhill for me.

I'll state my reason for wanting to quit the show despite being sad about it: Jim/Pam/Karen/Roy.

Roy is a jerk, sure, but a jerk who loved her. I think the writers really let the story suffer by dragging out Pam's relationship with him. It just made me pity the guy. She's clearly into another dude, and yet he can't see it. Why doesn't she just dump him and make it easier for him? I guess because the writers thought that would be too easy, but whatever.

So, Jim stays in Scranton and hooks up with Pa.. no, he took the job. Great. And, he gets a sweet girl who will so obviously have her heart broken over him. I really liked Jim up until the end of season three. Sure, he kissed a soon to be married girl, but he was the right one for her, etc etc. But then, he gets a new, perfectly nice girl in his path, lets her fall for him, dates her, leads her on, then dumps her. 

I get that Pam and Jim are meant for each other, but their just dicks in how they go about it, and don't seem to care much for others. 

Tl;dr: I don't really like Jim and Pam mainly because of how they ended up treating poor Karen, and am wanting to quit the show. Does it get better?",DunderMifflin,1493606375,apposet24,17,0,True,2017-04-30

So I had this really realization about Jim and Pam's first kiss.,"In ""Goodbye, Toby"", Michael is freaking out about Holly. He is sure they are soulmates, yada, yada. 

Jim advises Michael to continue courting Holly as friends first. 

He begins to recite all the different experiences he and Pam have had around the office. One in particular stood out to me: he says ""actually our first kiss was right over there.""

Of course, he's referring to casino night when he confessed his love to Pam. 

BUT WAIT! What about the time at Chili's when Pam got really drunk?!

Well clearly, he doesn't consider that their first kiss. And I think it's because Jim is the kind of guy we all should be. He knew Pam was drunk and he knew she probably wouldn't have consented to kissing him if she were sober so he doesn't even abuse that moment by including it as their first kiss. 

Basically he counts their first kiss as the first kiss he knew she fully supported because she wasn't drunk (she even says so). I think that's pretty cool.

Theory: Jan' s daughter is actually Hunter's baby.,"So, here's my theory. I believe Jan cheated on Michael and got pregnant by her ex-assistant Hunter, then made up the sperm bank story to take the blame off of both of them.

-Jan got pregnant while she and Michael were still dating. 

- The episode ""Dinner Party"" is the episode in which Jan and Michael break up,  so we can assume Jan is currently pregnant in the episode.  

- Jan consumes a lot of wine during ""Dinner Party"", something that she most likely wouldn't do had she known she was pregnant, especially considering her more naturalistic leanings during this point in time. 

- ALSO during ""Dinner Party"", Jan and Michael argue over having kids and how she wanted Michael to have a vasectomy. She yells at him, ""I'm sorry I don't want to bring kids into this screwed up world!""  This could be her not wanting to have a kid with Michael, but also could be seen as her not wanting kids at that point in her life, meaning she wouldn't have suspected being pregnant at the time.

- If she had gone to a sperm bank, she would know or suspect she was pregnant, because it would have been planned. 

-She most definitely had an affair with Hunter, which could very well have continued after she was fired.  

- Jan would never have admitted that Hunter was the father because he was 17  and it would also be her admitting to cheating on Michael. So the sperm bank story takes the blame off of Hunter and the idea that Jan cheated on Michael off the table.

I always thought it was because he doesn't want to drive. But, it is because he doesn't have a car! This is for 1 of 2 reasons: 

1. Because he drove it in the lake in 4:02 ""Dunder Mifflin Infinity""

Jim also constantly pranks Dwight with no problem on his side, and even goes as far to screw over Dunder Mifflin telling them that the Michael Scott Paper company is willing to sell, even though he knew that they were broke. That costed the company millions of dollars just so that Pam can have a job.

Then Andy threw it in his face. He didn't follow up on his successes. He was complacent. He was stuck in excuses. It became apparent that what was holding him back was himself. Like he said in his introductory meeting with Athlead (it's Athleap now) ""I'm just a warehouse manager. I shouldn't be here."" Thankfully he finally began believing himself, took the ball and ran with it from then on. All the old criticisms of him melted away when he began believing himself.

Thanks,"When I was 16 years old, my boyfriend of two years broke up with me for my best friend (who he'd been cheating on me with for 3 months). Then all the rest of my group of friends said that having me around was just too much drama. I was too heartbroken and I cried too much. They'd rather lose one friend than two. 
So I was alone. It was summer. I was in my bedroom surfing Netflix trying to find something to take my mind off of my shitty situation. That's when I found The Office. I binged all the seasons that we're on Netflix. Watching The Office didn't take away the pain, but it distracted me and made me smile and allowed me to get lost in a really wonderful story. I can easily say that this show helped me through one of the darkest and most painful times in my life. The Office was there for me when all of my friends decided I wasn't worth the trouble 
Now, several years later, when I'm stressed or sad or tired or overwhelmed, The Office is my go-to show.  I've probably watched the series 6 or 7 times, and it never fails to calm me down and cheer me up. So thanks to everyone who made the show.

(with all the specials, deleted scenes and webisodes)","i discovered The Office in 2017 (yes, no joke), and i binge watched the whole show in 3 weeks on netflix. i kinda feel bad that i watched 8 years of TV history in such a small amount of time. i loved every episode. The series finale of 'The Office' was just something else for me. I didn't experience something like this before. i watched many tv shows, but this was different. i didn't think that i'm so attached to the characters of this show. You wanted to be as witty as jim, loyal and hardworking as dwight and sweet as Pam. The sketches and writing were just magnificent and the chemistry of the whole cast was outstanding, especially between jim, dwight and pam. i felt like i was part of a family, where i can go every day. ""How do you know that you are in the good old days, without actually leaving them?"" Andy said it the best in the last episode. We always regret that we didn't appreciate the people around us enough, when we had the time. Appreciate what you have and not what you don't have. The pranks on dwight by jim, the awkwardness of michael scott, the randomness of creed and the relationship between jim and pam made this show so unique. i got so emotional in the finale, even after 3 days it's still in my head and i can't let it go. I don't know what to do with my life now. I can't describe enough how good this show is. I hope i could erase my memories and watch it for the first time again. i can't thank the creators enough for this masterpiece. i don't want to say goodbye to all this greatness, but thank you Greg Daniels, Jenna Fischer, John Krasinski, Rainn Wilson, Ed helms and all of the production team for this.

My Michael Scott Dream...,"##Gather around children.

The dream began with me sitting in the conference room. I was facing the doorway. When I looked outside of the glass, I saw Dwight making a sales call, Stanley sleeping, Phyllis was writing something, and everyone else was doing their normal ""Office Routine."" Pam walked by, then Jim came in. Keep in mind, that this was a late Season 2 setting. Jim was telling me how he liked Pam but was more interested in who I was. Kind of like getting to know me. We talked about football games and stuff. Then Michael walked in. Jim gave me the *Jim Face* then left. Turns out, it was a job interview. Michael started asking why I wanted to work there, then interrupted me to tell me some of his stand-up jokes. I ended up impressing him/making him like me cause I think Michael Scott is hilarious. However, I was a little annoyed cause normally when things seem good with Michael, they lead into a ditch somewhere in Mexico. So I got a little mad when I was just trying to get a job but he wouldn't let me speak. I started to feel like how Pam might feel if she was trying to work and Michael kept lolly gagging. Not sure what happened after cause I woke up. All in all though, such an amazing dream!

Another depressing thing I noticed about Scott's Tots..,"Obviously the whole premise is incredibly depressing and awful, but as I watched Michael's interactions with the kids, I saw that this was exactly who he wanted to be. The kids loved and admired him, which was what he wants more than anything else in the world: but also the way that he treated them showed the best side of him that we see in the entire series. He recognizes each kid by name, he hugs them and they hug him back with full trust and affection, and he has kept up with them- he remembers and comments on one kid's trumpet performance of ""When The Saints Go Marching In."" His attention to all of the kids is completely appropriate too- these are high school girls, some of them, and Michael does not say or do anything pervy or inappropriate- instead he compliments them on the things that they have worked hard for and are proud of.

At the end, in the car with Erin, he announces that he has ""a feeling"" about her. I think he's trying to recapture a bit of what he's just lost, in terms of the children's affection and the sensation of doing good for someone who needs to be given a chance. There is some beauty in his relationship with Erin, but when I think about how he generally treats all of the employees... the contrast between how he treats ""his Tots"" and them is very sad. I think that if Michael treated his employees with some of the affection and kindness as he treats ""his"" Tots in that episode (aside from, obviously, making extravagant promises and not keeping them), they might not love him, but they would at least respect him a bit. For example, if he complimented Pam's art the way he complimented the Tot's trumpet performance, and if he refrained from perving at her or making sexual comments, then Pam might have a bit more trust in him.

How much time passes between Dwight quitting and being rehired? (S3E13 - The Return),"In the aforementioned episode, I was struck by how emotional Angela and Dwight's reunion was (emotionally by their standards anyway). To me, that was a rather uncharacteristic display of feeling for them (and in public, gasp!). So I asked myself how much time passed between Dwight quitting and being hired back to elicit such a response? I have a couple of thoughts:

* Oscar also comes back from his vacation in this episode
* It was previously stated in S3E1 (Gay Witch Hunt) that Oscar was getting sent on a three month long trip to Europe
* 12 episodes (including S3E13) occur from that point

That means from E1 - E13, three months passed, give or take a week. We also know The Return takes place in early winter (given all the snow and it's shortly after A Benihana Christmas) which means those three months were probably November through January giving us a total of 92 days. Divide that by the number of episodes in between (12) means approximately seven days pass between episodes. That means Dwight was rehired only a week after quitting. The episode takes place on a Wednesday (Andy comes into Michael's office and says ""TGI-Wednesday""). 

To me, that makes the level of emotion in both Dwight and Angela far less probable. They had only not been working together for a single work week and likely saw each other three days prior on the weekend. A seven day gap between the two events also doesn't seem to explain the number of interviews Dwight goes on, not to mention the time it takes to be hired somewhere, start, and establish himself as a dominant salesman (as evidenced by the compliment Dwight's manager gives him for selling two printers in the morning). He can't have been working there too long however because Dwight's co-worker, Paris, was attempting to get to know him. Don't forget that we're also bounded by Oscar's vacation at three months.

Given all that, I'd put Dwight's absence at about a month. He quit shortly after New Year's (mid to late January) and then hired in mid to late February. 

Which begs the question: If Dwight and Angela were dating, did they just not see each other for a month? Granted they see less of each other but they're still dating. Maybe they're just that in love and the prospect of working with their soulmate makes them incredibly happy. It's the same with Jim &amp; Pam, why not Dwight and Angela?

Maybe I'm more annoyed by it because he is one of the characters we are suppose to constantly relate to.  I'll stop rambling and get to it.  My point is, just, the way both he and Andy (don't even get me started on Andy) almost reverse develop in the later seasons when a lot of the other characters really blossom and change for the better.....it just sucks and is really frustrating to have a character we're suppose to identify with go in a direction like that over multiple seasons.

Unfavorable opinion of Pam (and Jim) during first 3 seasons?,"Am I the only one who has a largely unfavorable opinion of Pam and her actions during the first 3 seasons?

I know the show really tries to paint Roy out to be the bad guy but both my girlfriend and I have come to the conclusion after rematching the first three seasons that honestly...most of the time she acted like a spoiled brat who wanted to have her cake and eat it too. Yeah, Roy wasn't the best boyfriend but nobody was forcing her to stay with him. She literally spent two seasons bouncing between Roy &amp; Jim and playing with both their emotions. She really came across as an undecided child who couldn't make up her mind about what she wanted. 

Again, Roy was far from a perfect boyfriend but what she did to Roy (constantly seeing another man right under his nose, pretty much cheating on him, and ENDING THEIR WEDDING) was far worse than anything he ever did to her. Honestly, his meltdown at Poor Richard's was completely justified. And so was his desire to kick Jim's butt. He had a right to be pissed.  

Her meltdown during the beach episode of Season 3 was honestly a bitch thing to do to Karen. She constantly said she wouldn't interfere in their relationship but what she said there was unwarranted and completely unfair to Karen. Honestly, both Karen and Roy really got fucked over. 

Most of what I'm saying also applies to Jim to a lesser extent. He knew she was a taken woman and that Roy flat-out told him that he trusted him during the party episode and what did he do? Went and professed his love to her anyways. Although at the end of the day, she was the one bouncing between two men so I would say what she did was worse. However, he ended up fucking over Karen as well, which was wrong to do. 

I don't know...the world seems to view them as the cute, model couple but I found myself really annoyed by them, at least during the first 3 seasons. Anyone else?",DunderMifflin,1478551479,maxiperalta54,4,0,True,2016-11-07

Jerry- Kevin and Toby
Tom- Kelly and Andy
Andy Dwyer- Kevin and Andy Bernard
Ron- Dwight and Angela
Ben- Jim and Dwight
Chris- Michael and Andy
Leslie- Michael and Dwight

A small plot change I wish had happened in season 9.,"Hey guys, first post here. Huge office fan for years, I'm rewatching parts of season 6 right now, but I keep thinking of something in season 9 that I wish had happened.

The whole camera crew reveal was kinda eh to me, it felt like a weirdly forced plot with the direction it took. However, ever since I saw the episode ""Vandalism"" I immediately wished that something different and much, much more emotionally fulfilling had gone down.

After Dwight and Pam vandalize Frank's truck after Frank vandalizes Pam's mural, Frank attacks Pam and Brian defends her, which again feels a bit forced.

I wish that Dwight had been there and defended Pam.

I've never seen anyone post this anywhere, but imagine if Dwight hadn't gone back inside and was outside with Pam when Frank gets outraged. Frank charges Pam and Dwight fights him off with pepper spray or nunchucks or something in spectacular Dwight fashion. It would have been the ultimate way to show that Dwight really cares about Pam, but after whooping Frank's ass Dwight could have been all ""whatever just doing my job"".

Just finished first re-watch of Seasons 8 &amp; 9.,"I watched The Office live during its entire run and re-watched the first 5 seasons a dozen times but I just finished re-watching Seasons 8 &amp; 9 for the first time. My thoughts:

Season 8:

- I disliked it during airing and disliked it even more on re-watch. 

- There were 0 compelling storylines and not enough humor to make up for it. 

- They tried too hard to make Andy Michael Scott 2.0 instead of adding his own twist to it. Andy's character didn't have the depth to carry the show like they wanted him to and IMO, they should have just made Robert California manager and kept Andy as a side character.

- Nellie brought absolutely nothing to the season and is my most disliked character of the entire series (She is acceptable in Season 9)

I might skip this season on re-watch as it was a drag to get through.

Season 9:

- I enjoyed this season live and liked it even more on re-watch.

- The humor wasn't as strong as Season's 1-5 but I found it funnier than Seasons 7 &amp; 8. 

- The Jim/Pam storyline was an amazing ending to their arc. Once a romance gets stale on a TV show it never recovers, but the writers found a way to make them matter again and it really brought some realistic conflict into their relationship. 10/10 job on PB&amp;J. 

- Andy's character was much more interesting this season as slimy and ignorant as opposed to a love-able doofus

- Breaking the 4th wall was a brilliant way to end the show and I don't think we'll see another show end as perfectly as The Office did. 

Overall, I have yet to find another show that balanced humor, interesting characters and heart as well as The Office did for a majority of its run and can't wait for another re-watch soon!

Strange Indeed,"I watched the show all the way through and I found some inconsistencies that I feel I should write down:

-In the scene where they're in the conference room having a meeting with Michael over the phone, Phyllis says ""Jim Carrey just walked in."" So actor Jim Carrey himself exists in The Office's universe, yet he later appears in Season 7 when he interviews for the regional manager position, and is playing a character, as opposed to just being Jim Carrey.

-Early in the show, Michael talks about Whose Line is it Anyway, so Chip Esten himself has to exist in The Office's universe as well. However, Chip Esten plays the role of Josh Porter on the show.

-When Michael proposed to Holly and the sprinklers go off, why doesn't the cameraman make any effort to cover up the camera, and why doesn't it break?

-When Jim has to abandon Michael at the gas station, why doesn't the cameraman just tell Michael where Jim went?

And yet here I am Sobbing when Michael Scott shows up for Dwight's wedding and losing it with Pam's closing scene. I mean I'm saying full on emotional sobbing. The show is only 9 seasons! I didn't want it to end. I don't want to even admit to myself that this is it. It's been over for 3+ years.

(paraphrase), and then he scales the gate and runs off. Then they have the goodbye Toby party. 

So my question is, had he already decided to actually go to Costa Rica for certain, and just used the awkward moment with Pam to tell everyone, OR was it just a dream of his, and then when the awkward Pam moment happened, it was so excruciating that he just decided there and then that he needed to leave the country?!

Does Pam have something against Erin at first?

A few minutes later, there's a scene where Erin asks Michael and then says to Pam ""We're all set"" and Pam quite coldly goes to reception and puts the candy on the bench.

I don't tend to like to read into small expressions too much but i feel like the show runners wouldn't put in such an irrelevant mini-plot if not for some purpose.

Do you have any favorite motifs or symbolism in the show?,"I really love Michael Scott's leaving arc, and how his employees give him the ""best boss"" trophy, replacing his old mug he bought himself.

Then, when he's not sure if he can handle going to Colorado, he pulls his mug out of the trash, a not-so-subtle symbol of him regressing back into his old ways, his comfort zone. 

Also there's the whole bird/plane motif, but that's a bit too deep for me to cover here, but articulated nicely in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/comments/43zwla/pam_michael_the_bird_and_the_plane/) .

Parallel between Pam/Roy breakup &amp; Jim/Pam engagement,"‚ÄúThe Negotiation‚Äù Episode S03E18 26:51-26:58 (approximate times), the cameraman is across the street from the diner Roy and Pam have just met at. To end the scene, the camera is positioned across the street and the audience can see Pam and Roy just past the cars that whiz by in the foreground. The two hug and then go their separate ways. We hear no audio or music for this, only the sounds of traffic.

This mimics when Jim and Pam get engaged in ‚ÄúWeight Loss: Part 2‚Äù S05E02‚Äì we see them at a gas station across the street as cars go by in the foreground. Although there is audio, it is difficult to hear over the rain and traffic. Jim proposes and then the two hug. The entire scene lasts from about 17:42-18:22.

The interactions are mirror each other in general cinematography, yet they are opposite in outcome. Obviously, the first ends with Roy and Pam walking away from each other. This indicates the ultimate end of their relationship. The latter ends with Jim and Pam embracing, indicating their commitment to one another.

I‚Äôm definitely deep into double digits of watching the series all the way through and I‚Äôve never noticed this little detail. I'm sure I‚Äôm not the first person to point it out, but I‚Äôm a couple of glasses of wine into my Monday recovery routine and I wanted to share this adorable tidbit with other Office lovers because it just made me appreciate the show even more, and after all these years I didn‚Äôt know that was possible &lt;3

Yet another reason this is the best show. 
Ever.

DM Scranton's over-stressed payroll,"Let me start off by saying this post in no way mistakes *The Office* for real life, this is more just an attempt at humorous observation  (although I think, considering this show often presented itself as an ""everyday American workplace,"" especially in the earlier seasons, the show could say it had some 'splaining to do).

In my professional life, most of the companies I've worked for have been around the size of DM Scranton. *The Office* came out when I was in high school, so it wasn't until I started working that I realized just how absurd it was that by the end of the show, the Scranton office boasted:

* An HR rep *and* a head of accounting (every company I've worked for has had a controller who took on HR duties and for a company that small that also had two more junior-level accountants, that seems like it would make more sense);
* A full-time receptionist *and* an office administrator (whose duties were never made explicitly clear);
* A full-time rep to corporate (Gabe) whose duties were also never made explicitly clear;
* Two full-time staffers dedicated only to supplier relations *and* quality assurance;
* ... plus somehow they needed a temp to juggle all that extra stuff.

While again I realize that this show is far from a documentary (except for, you know, the fictional documentary taking place within the series) but I do find it strange that they never even made a joke about how over-staffed the place was. The closest they ever came was in Season 2, the joke about one department with three people doing the work of two (accounting).

Plus, anytime there was talk of downsizing it always seemed to come down to ""Oh, which sales rep do we let go?"" instead of ""what other positions are redundant?"" Was this some sort of really subtle inside joke, or just lazy writing and hoping we wouldn't notice? Perhaps members of the supporting cast like Toby and Meredith and Kevin were popular enough that the show didn't want to risk writing them out?

So, real-talk: has anyone ever worked for a company that had as over-inflated a staff as Dunder-Mufflin Scranton?",DunderMifflin,1479233590,UnkieHerbivore,3,3,True,2016-11-15

"Would ""The Farm"" be a good show?","I was recently re-watching the episode ""The Farm"", from the ninth season, and it got me thinking what could've been if they had moved forward with this spin-off.

In my opinion, Rainn Wilson could've totally pulled off a solo show, but some things would've ended differently:

I don't think he would've married Angela, I don't see him spending his time between the office and the farm;

Dwight's siblings would've worked out great: his sister and her son were perfect for the ""adapting to the farm"" and introducing some Schrute traditions that she would've forgotten about it.

His brother would bring all the ""worm farm experience"" into the show, and would probably have some funny exchanges with Dwight in regards of using marijuana.

Mose was perfect for the whole show, and bringing in Zeke, his brother, would've been totally awesome. They could also explore their interest for motorcycles, since Zeke arrives in one and Mose uses one to try to go over all the cars in the ""Garden Party"" episode.

The other 5 farms (I think) that shared borders with his aunt's farm would bring interesting characters, and we could totally get some scenes with old pals from the office like Pam and Jim visiting, sometimes going to Kevin's bar, maybe some Michael Scott action selling beets to Colorado, idk!

Let's just discuss what could've been.

Also, I'd just like to add that, when I first watched the show, I thought it would be a bad idea to give Dwight a spin-off series, but now I regret that they never did it...",DunderMifflin,1463056133,darkfrozzy,13,9,True,2016-05-12

My defense of the almost cartoonish nature of the characters in the later seasons,"I was reading a post over on /r/PandR talking about the similarities of the two shows, and found a comment that basically said it was a shame that the characters became to outrageous in the final seasons, compared to their more muted personalities in the beginning. 

Particularly Jim and Pam who, in the earlier seasons, are the only normal ones. They are the voices of reason, and seem to be written as the smartest people in the show. By the end, however, and they are completely different. Similar things can be said for Dwight, who goes from monotone and borderline psychopathic to relatively carefree and humorous by the end. 

I know the first time I watched the later seasons I too was disappointed by the change. I felt like the show got lazy and changed everything I liked about the show. Now I've watched the series a number of times, and I've really come around to the direction it took and I'm here to tell you why. 

Jim and Pam go from the young ones who are above all the office antics to the mom and dad propagators of the office antics. It shows how they have gone from hating Dunder Mifflin to finding a home there. It's the place they fell in love, and their coworkers became their friends and family. Jim and Dwight go from enemies to close friends. Jim and Pam grow to love Michael. Their character change shows how they learned how much heart the office had, and even though some of their coworkers were borderline offensive, they all meant well, loved each other, and created an office that was extremely fun and loving. It seems like one of the best workplaces in the world.

Dwight, on the other hand, changes (at least IMO) because he sort of 'loses it' when he fails to be promoted to regional manager multiple times. It starts when Jim becomes co-manager. It gets worse with every regional manager chosen who isn't him (temporarily Charles, Robert California, and then worst of all, Andy). His entire world comes crashing down. The job he has coveted for years goes to his enemies and people he looks down upon. He has given up, and a screw goes loose, and you see this big change in him. But it's like he goes crazy in a good way - it allows him to let his guard down and be playful and happy.

I've realized that stories need arcs. Characters need to develop. They need to be *characters* in order for the show to remain interesting. If we had nine seasons of monotone awkward moments and Jim and Pam silently hating everything, the show would have gotten extremely boring.

So if you're one of the people who really doesn't like the direction the show took, just like I did, think a little harder and watch again. You might just change your mind!!",DunderMifflin,1463882494,divaslam,18,24,True,2016-05-21

Question about the episode Office Olympics,"So I decided to rewatch the series earlier this week (one of the better decisions I've made lately) and just got through the Office Olympics episode (season 2)

I am quite confused about why Michael was given a medal (presumably by Jim) at the end of the episode. The most reasonable explanation I could come up with was Jim wanted to complete the games and the award ceremony was a mandatory conclusion. And the best he could do this whilst raising the least suspicion with Michael and Dwight was to involve them. (The first time I saw the episode I assumed that Jim somehow understood that Michael felt burdened by his mortgage and intended to make him feel better- but this explanation for some reason doesnt seem to cut it this time around).

*Just in case anyone wants a reminder, this was the episode where Michael took  Dwight along to finalise his first home purchase with his real estate agent, leaving the office unsupervised.  The office jumped at the opportunity to skive and organised the office olympics. Meanwhile Michael realises the financial baggage he would be incurring from his new home purchase. He returned to the office feeling so devastated that he did not even notice his employees were in the middle of fun and games- without him(!). The athletes dispersed but shortly after, Jim told Pam to ready the award ceremony. The gold medal was awarded to Michael and the silver to Dwight and the champions basked in the spirited celebrations (the episode ends with Michael, for the first time in The Office, being moved to tears)*

I restrained myself from here until I'd finished the show...,"Hello r/DunderMifflin,

After about a week and a half of intense Netflix sessions, and riding on the emotional roller coaster to indulge in surely one of the greatest television shows of this generation, my first watching of The Office came to a close sometime around 4 am last night. 

Oh my balls, that finale was so good.

As I'm sure you all know, this show is jam packed with  moments that are jaw dropping, heart warming, awe-inspiring, and often spine-tinglingly cringe worthy (particularly in the earlier seasons). As a result of this, many Reddit surfing breaks were taken to give my emotions a chance to gather themselves. That's how I found this place.

After a close shave with spoilers, I decided to withhold from browsing here until I had seen the final curtain close, and when I got here, I was completely blown away by how active this subreddit is. Like holy shit, I was anticipating maybe a 5 posts per week type deal but damn, this thing is huge. Thats what she said.

Could we have daily discussion threads for each episode in chronological order?,"I feel like it would be cool if we had kind of like a marathon of office episodes, one episode a day for 201 days, (the total number of episodes), and there would be a discussion thread. 

I think it'd be cool because then we could talk about specific episodes collectively, maybe there was something someone noticed that people didn't notice before, or maybe some trivia type stuff or maybe just to discuss the episode, so of course the threads would be spoilers for the entire series. 

I'm not sure how active the mods are on this sub but maybe we could even get the threads stickied? 

Thoughts?

Edit: I've decided to start a subreddit dedicated to watching tv shows one episode a day with a discussion thread posted for each episode every day, and its going to begin with the office.

Season 4 - The season where everything changed,"I'm binge watching the show, and I really feel like Season 4 is where things kind of go off the rails.  Before season 4, the show seemed pretty well grounded in reality.  Michael's antics were strange, but believable, and the corporate reaction from Jan and David Wallace seemed pretty believable too.

In season 4, Michael started doing things no reasonable person would do.  Fun Run, Dunder Mifflin Infinity (where he drives into a lake), Branch Wars (where he and Dwight raid the Utica office), Survivor Man (where Michael tries to prove he can live in the woods), etc all feature Michael doing things that require a lot of suspension of disbelief that wasn't required in earlier seasons.

This is also the season where Kevin starts his decline into retardation.  In the season finale, Dwight tricks Holly into thinking that Kevin is mentally disabled, which would not have worked in earlier seasons.  From here on out, Kevin just keeps getting dumber and dumber.

This is also where we see Jan and Michael's relationship take a strange turn, reaching its climax in Dinner Party in which Jan is so weirdly abusive towards Michael.  Not to mention the other strange relationship shake-ups within the Andy, Dwight, and Angela love triangle.

The other weird thing is how much the addition of Holly changed the Michael character in the season finale.  He suddenly learns how to exercise restraint when it comes to his feelings, and he sort of becomes a guy you kind of want to root for.  By the time Michael leaves Scranton, he has become a much more lovable protagonist than before, and I feel like this first set of successful interactions with Holly are the start of it all.

This seems to be the first season where we see people in the office start to really act out of character and test the limits of our suspension of disbelief, and it gets more and more crazy as the series goes on.  Not that I dislike the later episodes, just that season 4 seems to be the season where the whole tone of the show changed.",DunderMifflin,1447270765,MadDogTannen,4,0,True,2015-11-11

Jim's advice to Dwight,"""I don‚Äôt know what you want me to tell you, man. All I know is that every time I‚Äôve been faced with a tough decision, there‚Äôs only one thing that outweighs every other concern ‚Äì one thing that will make you give up on everything you thought you knew. Every instinct. Every rational calculation

Love‚Ä¶ Dwight, listen, no matter happens, you gotta forget about all the other stuff. You gotta forget about logic and fear and doubt. You just gotta do everything you can do get to the one woman who‚Äôs going to make all this worth it. At the end of the day, you gotta jump...""

Getting to the end of The Office has always been super emotional for me as it is with most. When I started this run though, I was so perfectly happily engaged and planning a wedding. We ran an amazing business together and my life was the definition of ""perfectenschlag.""

As I sit here finishing the finale, sitting alone in an empty apartment, ex-fianc√© 3000 miles away, it's hard to feel like things are going to be okay. Hearing Jim's speech tonight was exactly the tv therapy I needed. She left because she wasn't good enough for herself. She never got a chance to become her own complete person and no amount of love that I could give her was enough to convince herself that she was good enough. I guess what I'm leaving with, as The Office comes to an end yet again, is the resolve that I'm not going to give up on her and knowing what is important is my greatest tool. I know it's all written tv, but knowing Jim had to watch Pam go through her own period of growth makes it all so much easier and much more real. 

I hope this can be helpful to other people struggling with the same issues and I hope it doesn't come off as whiny as that was the furthest thing from what I was going for haha. Just wanted to share this and Facebook is too busy with the Starbucks controversy right now to appreciate this. 

Tldr: Jim has some solid advice.

I just watched the finale for the first time...,"So I was really late to the show, but The Office got me hooked a couple of months ago and I've binged watched the crap out of it.

Just now I watched the last episode, Finale, and I am SO happy the way it all ended. I'm just about crying as I'm typing this. Every single character got closure. Everything fell into the exact place it belonged (especially Creed talking about human beings' ability to make a mundane place feel like home, then being taken to jail hahaha)

So now I feel extremely empty inside, it's like at the end of Lord of the Rings where you don't want to give up on the characters yet - you want to see where things are going, how they're doing. 

I absolutely loved the characters' development, how everyone could hate each other but deep down they had a deeper bond. Dwight and Jim's relationship showed this in particular. It was just beautiful seeing all these characters mold into more and more lovable creatures. Hell I even almost cried for Toby when the whole office cheered him on when he came to the wedding afterparty.

Oh and Jim and Pam's decision to actually sell the house and move to Texas to pursue something bigger. That reminds me of something a wise man once said: ""You miss 100% of the shots you don't take -Wayne Gretzky"" -Michael Scott

"Something I've been wondering, regarding the series ending","I'm no expert on how American tv series are produced, like how much of a series is completely filmed and edited before the first episode airs, as a preface.

In the final season, we had the pilot episode of The Farm, which was to be a post Office spin off. In it, Dwight has a brand new love interest, whose name escapes me. Obviously the pilot didn't get picked up into a series, and the episode was edited into an episode of the main show. That love interest comes in in the last few episodes as Angela's love rival for Dwight. This leads me to wonder, had the Farm been successful and followed the Office after it ended, what were the original plans to end the show, if not it being Dwight and Angela getting married?

How the office changed my life.,"I was a huge fan of the office. I watched the first episode when it aired, and never missed an airing. I bought the DVDs and watched and re-watched. When I first got Netflix, the office was the first thing in my list. I took a trip to Scranton in 2008 to sight see. Huge office nerd. 
I had always had retail management jobs. I was made a store manager when I was 23 and just assumed I would do that forever. Earned good money, not great, but I hated retail. Like most retail managers, I lived my job. 70 hours a week, constant stress, extremely tired all of the time. 
Then I met my girlfriend. She liked me enough to tolerate the constant sounds of dunder mifflin. Pretty soon all of her conversations were sprinkled with quotes like mine. She was a receptionist for a copier company. Perfect. 
Our first child came. The first two years I was absent pretty much. I had reevaluate my job. I had been in retail almost 15 years, what else would I do? ""You're charming"" she said, get a job in b2b sales. ""Yeah, right, the boy raised on a farm with a white collar job"" I joked. ""Like Dwight?"" She replied. ""I'm much too laid back to be that aggressive"" I countered. ""Like Jim?"" She replied. 
I applied for a job on monster, but just one. President of the company called me in for an interview. One of my questions was, describe yourself in three words. I couldn't resist. ""Bears, beets, battlestar galactica."" We both had a good laugh. We spent the rest of the interview talking about the finale, which had just aired. He took me to his office and showed me his Threat Level Midnight poster. He hired me on the spot. Then my girlfriend walked into the office, she had been recruited by the CFO to be the new office manager. They didn't even interview her. They offered her a job on the spot. Turns out, the CFO and President were married and thought it would be cool to have a Jim and Pam or Dwight and Angela around. 
Turns out, I was a natural. I was making extremely high commission checks. I went from 50k a year to 90+. Every day, I get to go to the office with the mother of my two kids. There is office memorabilia everywhere. 
I would have never made that jump if it wasn't for the office. The over the top ""ineptitude"" of the staff of dunder mifflin fueled my confidence. My relationship with my boss started because of our mutual love for the show. If it weren't for the office I don't think I would have ever even tried. I get to LARP the show everyday and I love it. 
I know this was long and I appreciate you reading this. If anyone involved with the show is reading, sincerely, I thank you. To all office fans, I thank you.

I'm slightly afraid that I based my entire life path on that of Jim Halpert,"So you know how Jim decides in S09 that the best thing for his family is to accept a job in Philly that has some risk, but relatively high potential rewards, and that also somewhat pissed off his wife?

Well for a while there a couple years ago, I was smoking a LOT of weed and watching The Office a lot as well. Around the same time, I decided to apply to a fairly advanced graduate school in a city a few hours from my own, at the risk of pissing off of my (then) common law wife, for a chance at a much higher salary.

Long story short, my then-GF is now engaged to a new man, and I am almost done my masters with no real plan for afterward other than ""hopefully make a high salary"".

It's creepy how accurately the conversations that Pam and Jim have in S09 compare to the ones I had with my girlfriend. ""I can't believe this is happening"". ""We'll make it work"". So on, and so forth. We had almost the same conversations, word for word, but with completely different outcomes.

Also, how he becomes so heartless towards Erin with all of his previous romantic gestures. She's obviously going to ditch him and go for that New Jim.

He left seminary for a girl and got a dreadful HR job only to be left alone from the divorce.

Not desperate for love precisely, but for anything that is real and solid - a goal he never had accomplished the entire series.

This prompted me to wonder why the hell would Angela actually go so far with this ""relationship""? It does not give her anything. It's actually a constant source of annoyance for her. She's having an affair with Dwight, which might be exciting, but why the hell would she stick it out with Andy, going so far as almost marrying him?

Just finished watching through for the second time... Feels like dozens of paper cuts to the heart.,"The last two episodes kill me. I can get through nearly the entire series without tears (minus one or two happy ones during the wedding &amp; then when Jim and Pam go through counselling and they flash back to the wedding) but then the last two episodes come and I'm a mess. Jim's line about love when talking to Dwight in the second to last episode gets the tears ready to come: 
&gt; **Jim Halpert:** So what is the problem?
&gt;**Dwight Schrute:** Angela.
&gt;**Jim Halpert:** I don't know what you want me to tell you, man. All I know is that every time I've been faced with a tough decision, there's only one thing that outweighs every other concern. One thing that will make you give up on everything you thought you knew, every instinct, every rational calculation.
&gt;**Dwight Schrute:** Some sort of virus?
&gt;**Jim Halpert:** Love.
&gt;**Dwight Schrute:** Oh.
&gt;**Jim Halpert:** Dwight, listen: no matter what happens, you gotta forget about all the other stuff. You gotta forget about logic and fear and doubt. You just gotta do everything you can to get to the one woman who's gonna make all this worth it. At the end of the day, you gotta jump. You love Angela, Dwight. I think you always have.
&gt;**Dwight Schrute:** You're a good assistant, Jim.

The finale then brings me down a little in the beginning due to the light heartedness of the bachelor/bachelorette parties. However, it then moves to the discussion panel... and Erin meets her parents. Ellie Kemper's facial expressions and delivery of that whole bit is perfection. The goosebumps form, the tears well up until they're too big to do anything but fall down. 

From there, though, the rest of the episode of happy and fun and lighthearted and emotional. I'm fairly certain that goosebumps are present for the vast majority of this episode. I'm so glad that the final for this show was not just a clip episode of all the memories, that instead they took the time to really wrap some large aspects of the show up. 

I texted my girlfriend after the finale finished saying that I really want her to hear Jim's lines from the previous episode but she would have to watch the whole series to truly understand the gravity from said lines. Here's hoping I make another Dunder Mifflinite. I know whether or not she wants to watch it, I will rewatch it again sometime in the near future.

Contradictions/Interesting Stuff/Questions,"After finishing my 19th watch-through (btw, does anyone have me beat?), I just wanted to make this thread to see if people noticed these contradictions, interesting things, or found some themselves:

Contradictions:

* Pam skipped volleyball in high school gym class(period excuse), yet she went to volleyball camps most summers, played throughout school, and killed it when playing for the Scranton branch.

* A few of the characters had different job titles in the first season (Marybeth Palmer was an accountant)

* Kevin put down anal fissures, but not his foot disease when Dwight was in charge of the health-care plan

* Ryan Howard's ""hobbit"" friend Troy is somehow living in Scranton when Dwight is interviewing for the open sales position
_____________

Interesting Stuff:

* Phallus Vance and Erin both had scoliosis when they were young (another reason they thought they might be mother daughter?)

I'll keep updating this as I think of more.

Questions:

* Bob Vance and Phyllis cheat on each other, right?
* Are there Office conventions anymore?

I enjoyed Season 8,"I just finished Season 8 for the first time and I really like it. I've heard nothing but bad things about the season, so I went into it expecting it to not be very good. I was pleasantly surprised. Robert California is great and I really liked the Florida storyline. Hell, I would say Season 8 is better than Season 6 (not that any season is bad to me). I did however have 2 complaints/observations:

1. The episodes where Andy was in the ""B"" plot were much better than the episodes where he was in the ""A"" plot. As a big Nard Dog fan, I was a little disappointed with this. I feel like the writers tried to make him way more like Michael Scott than they should have (Andy was much more like Michael than Deangelo was in my opinion). I still enjoyed his character, but he was much better when the main focus of the episode wasn't on him.

2. The same applies to Darryl. I like Darryl, but not as a main character. I thought he was better in the earlier seasons where he showed up every now and then and didn't say a whole lot. I get that they needed some help after Carrel left, but I'm not a huge fan of Darryl as a main character. By the way, can someone please tell me what Darry does/why he has his own office? What does he do in his upstairs office that's so different when he stayed in the warehouse? Basically, what did Jo promote him to do?

the office saved me,"Let me preface this post by going over how 9th grade was probably the worst year of my life. All of my friends from middle school went to a different high school, and I was too awkward to make any new friends. My entire social life was in shatters for that whole year. My grades were also extremely shitty, and I basically had nothing at all to live for. I'd spend all day browsing /r/futurology and trying to find hope in weird technological advancements (as weird as that sounds). So anyway, I end the school year with like a 2.7 GPA, complete fucking shit. It's worse because of the fact that I kept telling my parents that I had all A's, and I even hid my 3rd quarter report card, so when they saw my grades for the 2nd semester they were extremely pissed. I was also rapidly gaining weight, and at my physical checkup the doctor told me that if I didn't start exercising I'd be overweight soon. The summer was extremely shitty for me because for the first time in my life I had literally no friends. I sat at home playing CSGO all day, even though I couldn't get passed Silver 2.

But then something miraculous happens.

On the last week of summer, I decide to just try to find some good shows on netflix. I decide to go to the comedy section and I see this show called ""The Office (US)"". I'd heard people talk about this show before but I never actually watched it. So I decided to try it. I instantly fell in love. Before summer was over, I binge watched all 9 seasons. At first I was really sad because I realized that I was done with the whole show. But then I realized that I could just keep on rewatching all of the episodes. Over. And over. And over.

So when tenth grade started, every day when I came back from school I would just watch the office, while doing my homework. Every day. And I swear to god this show is fucking magical, it fucking healed me. Slowly but surely my life fell back into place. My grades skyrocketed. I started working out. I made new friends.

Fast forward to today, it's the end of 10th grade and I have a 4.33 GPA, a lot of friends that in school, started working out, lost a lot of weight, oh yeah and I'm gold nova 2 in CSGO now. All thanks to this fucking amazing goddamn TV show.

Dwights were focused on when Jim's roommate greets him and comments on his sock-things. And Angela's are shown when she's talking to Jim by the barbeque, commenting on getting something on them.

WELP... I just finished watching this show. Here is my personal review of this amazing series.,"First off, this is definitely my all time favorite show. I was reluctant at first, but I tried it and immediatly fell in love. The casting, the scripting, everything was pure genius. 

This show was filled to the brim with the perfect mix of humor, love, confusion, and heartbreak. All these elements keep you wanting more and more until you find yourself watching until 4:00 AM. I've never felt such a strong connection between a TV show (or movie for that matter) and myself. You'll find yourself caring for these characters as if they were your friends or family. All around, I give this a 4.9/5. This show had me laughing and entertained the whole time, but also it was the only thing that has ever really broken my heart. From Michaels departure, to the finale, it brought actual tears. This is the only show I have ever watched where it left me absolutely puzzled and sad that it isnt on air any longer.

But I would 10/10 go on that emotional rollercoaster again!

Dwight seems more like a stuck up, know it all, which I don't get after the first episode. Especially when he sits there and talks about his car. He also has a ""I don't care about my job"" attitude which is not Dwight...

Inconsistency Found (Meredith's Birthday),"From Season 4 EP 7 ""Survivorman"",

Jim: ""Yeah I do remember yeah""
Angela: ""It's birthday month, Creed's is today, Oscar's is week after next, Meredith's is at the end of the month.""


From Season 1 EP 4 ""The Alliance""

Pam to Michael: ""[the next birthday] would be Merediths""
Michael: ""Yes, alright! Come on down Meredith!""
Pam: ""But its not til next month""

*Note she is looking at the April month in her calender, and more specifically pages of her calender with days April 4-10, not quite the end of the month (an additional side inconsistency).  


So say that Creed's birthday is day n (Around the first few days of ""Birthday Month""). That makes Kellie's birthday about n-7, Oscar's n+14, and Meredith's n+25 or so.

The inconsistency I am claiming to have found is that Pam was wrong about the upcoming birthdays in S1EP4. There could have been at least 2 birthdays before Meredith's coming up.",DunderMifflin,1415851900,CodyUpInThisBich,5,9,True,2014-11-12

Pam and Angela,"I've noticed and really enjoyed the way Pam defends and interacts with Angela in a few of the episodes.

In the episode when Michael burns his foot, and Dwight gets a concussion while on his way to pick up Michael, Pam finds out Dwight is going to be okay after going to the hospital, and she lets Oscar know Dwight will be okay. She does this because she knows it's a secret that Dwight and Angela are together, so she gets the message to Angela without making her relationship with Dwight apparent.

In the episode when Michael goes through the box of complaints, Dwight asks why the complaints against him were redacted, not knowing they were complaints from Angela. To change the subject quickly, Pam volunteers to have Michael go over her complaints before there was time for everyone to realize Angela had complained about Dwight and redacted the complaints upon the start of their relationship.

Never has any book, movie, or any other series made me react that way at the end. I know I'm a year and a half late but it really was the most perfect ending to the series that there could have been.

I never realized how much more content there is, even in some of the actual episodes themselves.

For instance, S3E12/13 (""Traveling Salesmen"" / ""The Return"") aired as an hour-long special originally, but Netflix separates it into two, 21-minute episodes and as a result, cut out several great scenes ‚Äî even whole subplots:

- A great, heartwarming development of Pam and Angela's ""friendship,"" including Angela offering to give Pam one of her kittens.
- Pam winning an art contest, and telling people in the office; but the only one who is really excited for her is Jim (much to the dismay of Karen).
- More of Jim and Dwight's tag-team salesmanship tactics.

I've noticed this on several occasions with several different episodes, especially the ones that aired originally as hour-long segments.

Am I the only one who feels like Pam was a raging bitch to Karen?,"Karen fell in love with a guy who came to Stamford with zero prior knowledge about Pam.  She moved to Scranton instead of finding a job elsewhere for said guy.  She worked with guy (Jim, duh)'s old coworkers for so long, alongside the woman that Jim was REALLY in love with and had zero clue about it till Phyllis told her.  She had to deal with them flirting with each other in FRONT of her.  Then there were all these instances where Pam was a bitch:

First, she was cold to Karen.  It made sense because even though Pam hadn't admitted it to herself, she was in love with Jim.

Then, omg there was the beach.  I realize that was a cathartic moment for her, but really?  You had to say that in front of Karen who did nothing wrong?

Then, AFTER the beach, Pam goes into the break room and really condescendingly told Karen, ""I'm not sorry about what I said, I'm sorry if it made you feel weird,"" with a really bitchy attitude.

Then she was being super passive aggressive towards Karen.

I WILL cede Pam that she DID help Karen when it came to Karen moving in close to Jim.  And I will say that Karen knew that Jim still loved Pam and remained with him since Jim told her that.

But I feel like after this, I never really liked Pam.  Until Jim was sorta douchey to her Season 9.  But even then she had her fair share of bitchiness.

"I just finished the series, and I have a few questions...","Hey everyone, 

I loved the office. It is firmly my favorite comedy TV show that I have ever watched. I had to fight back some tears to prevent my roommate thinking i'm a wuss during the finale. But anyways, just finished yesterday, and I have a few questions about a few things...

Firstly, I liked Andy's character until season 9, then they made him into kind of a prick IMO. He became irritating and just more of a jerk than funny, but then everyone is nice to him at the end. Was I the only one that noticed this? Also he risks everything to go get Erin, succeeds, and then treats her like shit. He goes to the camp with Wallace's son and is now more ""decisive"", but he is just a dick. Then he just sails off inexplicably, and is just an asshole to the girl he had just proclaimed his undying love for. 

Next, I knew that Michael Scott would make an appearance in the last episode, but I was surprised at how little screen-time he got. I kinda get that they didn't want him to take over the episode, but it seemed a little more of him would have been awesome.

Then, Jim was my favorite character throughout the series, and I was kinda torn on how they wrapped up his and Pam's storyline. I liked that he chose family over work/money, and it seemed like Pam just changed her mind overnight about not wanting to move. I guess Austin is better than Phili though (I am from Austin, haha). 

I really began to like Erin towards the end as well, and I loved that it was her mom that asked her a question. But I have two things that bothered me there. First I thought that adding in that it was her dad too was too much, the mother scene was so emotional but the father was like ""hey here i am"" with no buildup. Also, what happened with her and Plop? Did they stay together or not? 

Dwight is also one of my favorites (as I'm sure he is most people's), but the way they had him fire Kevin and Toby was weird to me. I get the reason why for Kevin, and I liked the reunion and that Kevin wasn't too mad, but why Tobey? Did I miss something?

Lastly, I just wanna say how much I enjoyed the show. For whatever reason, I get really really into the TV shows that I watch, and the office will have a lasting impact on me that is for sure.

Job fair,"So I have been watching the office for the first time and I'm not sure anyone cares, but I am beginning to think Michael Scott is is a genius manager. In the episode ""Job Fair"" Michael seems to almost purposefully destroy any chance at finding employees. He makes Pam do all this stupid stuff like go all the way back to the office for a single sheet of paper. Then he demeans her by saying the kid has a solid shot of getting laid by her. At a job fair. Why was Pam at the job fair? Maybe to get her a better job? Maybe to force her to look for a better job. 

Meanwhile he sends Jim (solid salesperson) and the possible worst salesman Andy who always messes around. Kevin is also considered to be a bad accountant.

One relationship I find touching..,"Angela and Oscar.  I know Angela gave him a hard time about things but 2 things :

1 - In Season 3 ep 18, when Roy comes in to get his last check, Angela stands to hand it to him and she kinda nudges Oscar to stand in front of her. Seeing how Roy went to attack someone, she could have stood behind Dwight and no one would think twice about it. I thought it was a touching moment with them.

2 - Of course it's how Oscar came to her aid when she was homeless and looking to live in a tent. I'm sure that everyone else could also see something was off but he was still the one to take her in. And they end up so good together in helping each other with Phillip and whatnot.

-*Former* salesman, but still closes a few deals that we get to see

-I believe he also won the Dunder Mifflin Salesman of the Year Award years ago

-Is known to have been a great salesman under Ed Truck before being promoted


**Stanley:**

-Not one of the main options you might think of, but when talking to Robert California, Andy notes that Stanley has the most consistently high sales record of anyone in the branch

I'm working on putting the deleted scenes into the originally aired episodes! I will post each on in time for the weekly discussion threads.,"Here is Season 1: Episode 1 - Pilot

https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6uMDv7Q9Uk1RWNndG5xX3E5SHc/edit?usp=sharing

I missed the deadline for Thursdays discussion thread, but Episode 2: Diversity Day is finished up, so I'll put that up as well.

I was forced to use torrents, as YouTube and DailyMotion both vetoed my upload. I have crazy slow upload speeds, 1Mbps, so I could definitely use some help seeding.

Info about the edited episode:

My source for the deleted scenes is a terrible 720x416 .mkv file. The source for the episodes was a much better 1280x720 .mkv file. I converted both into a decent 720x480 file, with less than ideal letter boxing at the bottom. It's the best I can do to make it work with the deleted scenes.

It is often apparent which scene is a deleted scene based on the white balance and color difference. I was too lazy to color correct, so deal with it. The later seasons have much better sources for the deleted scenes, so after this first season the quality will be much more ideal. There may be continuity issues or odd spots in the first episode, the second episode was much easier to fit the deleted scenes in.

There are about 7-10 minutes of deleted scenes in each episode. Great material for discussion. I will upload the torrent a day or two before the Sunday and Thursday discussion threads.

Just re-watched the entire series and here's what I noticed.,"1. This show just gets better every time you watch it. Little things you never noticed show up every time you watch it.

2. It gets better with every season and peaks at season 7

3. Season 8 lacked direction once Carell departed, however it gave the other characters a chance to grow, and the addition of Dwight Jr and Plop was great.

4. Season 9 was potentially the greatest final season of any show I have seen in my life. Almost flawless. The drifting apart of PB&amp;J was hard to watch, but the way Jim wins her back is inspiring. And the minor Return of Carell is simple and not over shadowing at all.

5. Rainn Wilson deserves far more credit for his role as Dwight. He is a brilliant actor.

6. The show doesn't age. While it has a few cultural references. They're very carefully chosen, and the jokes won't age. I look forward to watching this series over and over again for years to come.

7. Carell's exit from the show was my favorite episode. Not because I wanted him to leave, but because it is so tastefully done. So emotional. And so perfect to see him so full of hope to start his life with Holly.",DunderMifflin,1400499259,pkarrasch182,65,209,True,2014-05-19

Angela is a horrible person,"I spend a good part of the weekend watching seasons 8 and 9 again.  Among other things, these two seasons served to reinforce to me one of the most glaring facts of this show:  Angela is a horrible, horrible person.  So completely hypocritical, judgmental, condescending, immoral, bitter, selfish, mean, and just awful.   And all of that in a package that is just bursting with pomposity, self-righteousness, and disdain for others.  It makes you wonder how she could be accepted by the others in the office for so long.  She‚Äôs worse than Todd Packer by a mile, because at least Packer was a one-dimensional pervert who accepted who he was.  Angela, on the other hand, was the complete opposite of who she believed herself to be.  She got off on hurting others, especially those who cared for her.  You could fill a book on her countless hypocrisies, and yet she would never admit them‚Äîor anything else she did wrong. She is a horrible person and yet she ends up with a happy ending with Dwight for some reason. Ugh.

The burning Office questions that will never be answered.... and the implications of what those answers may be? Would love to hear anyone's opinion on the answers to these questions.,"This is in reference to the Pam and Brian storyline in Season 9. 

You may want to watch the final scene where Pam has her last conversation with Brian at his apartment.

* Why does Pam storm out of Brian's apartment so quickly? 

* Did she know she was being filmed at Brian's apartment?

* Did she storm out because she was upset that her and her coworkers had been recorded for 10 years and had no privacy?

OR...

* Did she storm out because she realized that even though she turned off her microphone, Brian told her that they had microphones that could pick sound up anyways, and she realized that Jim would see/hear her at Brian's apartment on film?

Finally, Pam seemed very happy and content to be sitting on Brian's porch drinking beers with him until they began talking about her lack of privacy at any moment during her work hours. So here is the question that will never be answered:

"""Threat Level Midnight"" is actually a well-structured three-act piece of cinema","Okay, so obviously *Threat Level Midnight* suffers from awful dialogue, terrible acting, and one of the least-dramatic ice-skating chases ever, but when I watched it, I couldn't help but realize that the plot was actually very professionally structured.

Most movies follow a basic three-act structure, and *Threat Level Midnight* follows it perfectly. Observe:

Act 1: this first act serves to introduce the world. We're supposed to learn about the protagonist and then he is supposed to be faced with a problem. In *TLM*, we meet Michael Scarn, learn about his life and history, and then he is presented with a problem.

The end of act one is punctuated by a ""big event"" (this is the official term for it). The big event is supposed to get things moving and more or less explains what the movie is going to be about. In *TLM*, the big event is the meeting with the president. The president explains what the movie will be about (stop Goldenface) and then there's the ""dramatic"" coin flips, which draw Scarn into the action.

Act Two: Act two involves the protagonist working to reach his goal. In this case, it's Scarn working to stop Goldenface. He learns where the hostages are, learns how to skate, gets into the all-star game, and confronts Goldenface.

The end of act two is punctuated by a ""low point,"" wherein the protagonist seems to have lost everything and is defeated (think of *Star Wars*: Obi-Wan is dead, Alderaan destroyed, etc. Things look bad for Luke). In this case, Scarn is a wanted man, he's lost his confidence, and the all-star game is only a day away.

Act Three: act three involves the protagonist rallying and fighting back to accomplish his goal. This fight usually culminates in one final climax (destroy the Death Star, get E.T. to his spaceship, storm the town hall and find Bane, etc.) In this case, it's Scarn getting to the game and launching the puck. He does so, and saves the day.

Act three ends with a little denouement, where we get a brief glimpse of the happily ever after: Scarn is back home with Samuel L. Chang, the day is saved, and things are back to normal.


so yeah, *Threat Level Midnight* might suck, but give it credit for being well planned-out! ",DunderMifflin,1401197521,domoarigatodrloboto,4,7,True,2014-05-27

A few thoughts on Meredith...,"Meredith Palmer is the office alcoholic. She presents herself in a way that lets the office and the audience know that she openly admits her ""problems"" without any form of remorse or concern about what people think or assume about her. Even though I like her character (as I do every character since they are all so unique and colorful), and that the show is technically fiction, I feel that sometimes the writers take her personality and confessions a bit too far.

For example, during one of the conference room one-on-one interviews with the camera/audience, the topic was cheating in relationships. She overtly states, ""I've never cheated on, been cheated on, or been used to cheat with. I always ask everybody in the room, are *you* in a relationship?"" In my opinion, this is not something someone would so calmly converse about at work, especially directly into a camera filming a documentary that will eventually be released to the general public. Also, during the episode 'The Duel', she states (to the camera), ""I always have guys fight over me. Usually it's about which one gets to hold the camera."" Collectively, there are many examples of her overt willingness to talk about her promiscuity outside of the office environment (and sometimes at work).

Another very important example is when she willingly admits to the office that she has genital herpes and doesn't understand why anybody would think it's a big deal. One of the things I love about the show is that even though it is a fictional account of a somewhat dysfunctional office, it usually comes off as feeling very realistic and sits just on the border of taking situations too ""over the top"". But sometimes I feel like Meredith's confessions and antics are the result of the writers trying too hard to portray her character as a conspicuously functioning alcoholic whore. In my opinion, not all the time, but sometimes her appearance on camera breaks the story's realistic flow by saying or doing something completely outlandish and overtly inappropriate. Does anybody else have similar thoughts?

S5E01 Weight Loss English/Spanish Comparison,"Hi everyone! As a long time fan of The Office and this subreddit, I notice that the writers do a good job of putting little easter eggs in episodes that make it fun for fans to find.

I'm not sure if this counts as an easter egg, but at the end of S5E01 ""Weight Loss"", there may be a reference to S3E03 ""The Coup"". Just before Toby talks about his time in a Costa Rican hospital, the camera lingers a bit on a Spanish language show. 

The man in a suit on the show says, ""Genial! Ven aqu√≠, dame un abrazo, perra"" which translates to, ""Great! Come here, give me a hug, bitch"" in English.

This quote reminds me of the scene in The Coup where Michael forgives Dwight after trying to sabotage him and his job. Michaels states, ""'Hug it out, bitch.' That is what men say to each other after a fight. They hug it out, and in doing so they just let it go, and walk away, and they're done"".

DunderMifflin's Thursday Episode Review Thread! Season 2: Episode 1 - The Dundies,"We're kicking off the second season today! I haven't seen this episode in quite some time, so I really don't have much of a pre-write up for this. IIRC this is really when the characters start to become who we know them as. As The Office neared the end of the season, many of the actors and actresses were excited at the prospect of The Office actually becoming a massive success, in contrast to the first season.

An excerpt from the wiki page;
""'The Dundies' represented a turning point in the series, in which the show found its own tone and differentiated itself from the British version.""

So with that said;

* Are the characters developing into who we know them as? (Michael in particular)
* Are there any particular cultural references you noticed? (such as Fat Albert)
* Any likes/dislikes?
* Any plot points that bothered or excited you?

Looking forward to the responses! Glad to see some people sticking with the review!

Hear me out.....Creed is the reason Pam &amp; Jim ended up together.,"I have made an observation and I'd like for others to weigh in.

I am convinced that Creed is a big reason why Jim &amp; Pam ended up together. 

Hear me out!

 In Casino Night when Jim confesses his love to Pam and she turns him down, she goes back into the office to call her Mom. Shortly after, Jim enters the room and grabs her and kisses her without saying a word.

In the episode Lecture Circuit (I forget if this is part 1 or 2), Andy is talking to Creed about a girl he likes and is asking advice on what to do, Creed proceeds to say ""Just go right in and kiss her"", Andy says ""You think that will really work?"" then Creed says ""When have I ever steered you wrong, Jim?"".

Creed confuses Andy for Jim in that moment, and that makes me believe that in Casino Night Jim was distraught and spoke to anyone he could about his predicament. Creed might've been next to him and Jim told him of his woes, and Creed gave him the advice to ""Just go right in and kiss her"", and that's exactly what he did.

""When have I ever steered you wrong, Jim?"" since that advice proved to be good because Jim got the girl.

I don't think I'm reaching here at all. The first time I saw that scene with Creed and Andy I immediately connected the 2 scenes, but I never see anyone ever mention it here.

*What do you want me to do, Jim?*

**A glass of water would be a start.**

*No. There are people...*

*Symphonies don't have any money! Public TV is bust. I can't do anything about it. I can't--, you know...*

*There is just one of me. And there is a thousand of them. And rabies wins.*

This is the fourth time I'm watching through the series, and never before have I thought twice about this scene. If it wasn't for the line ""symphonies don't have any money!"" I wouldn't have taken notice. That line seems very out of place, even so considering that is to be expected from Michael. So I watched the scene a few times, and I felt that maybe this whimpering has more meaning to it than what appears on the surface.

I don't know. Did anyone else pick up on this? I recommend those of you who don't remember this scene to go watch it again. It's probably not on youtube though, since it's not very memorable. I'd put all my thoughts and reflections over the scene in here, but I don't wanna bother with a wall of text unless there is any interest in the topic. So, is there?

Significance of the last line of the show,"I'm surprised that this sub has not talked about the final line of the show as much as it merits in my opinion.

When Pam says, ""There's a lot of beauty in ordinary things, isn't that kind of the point?"" the entire show's purpose is established. It's a brilliant line.

Other comedies are over-the-top. Look at any of the ones popular right now. Always Sunny, Arrested Development, Eastbound and Down, Southpark, Family Guy, The League, HIMYM. The humor in all of these is largely derived from the things that are *different* from normal life, the things that make you laugh because they're so foreign and ridiculous.

But The Office takes the most ordinary setting possible, a paper company, and makes it real. When you laugh, it's because you're laughing at the absurdity of normal, ordinary life. The awkward glances exchanged when Pam gets off the scale and everyone tries to figure out her weight, Michael's attempt to be vague when distinguishing the two Asian women, Jim's reactions to Creed's invitation to throw rocks down the quarry with him. 

And in this boring, stupid paper company, we the viewers are given something more real than what other comedies can offer. We genuinely care for the love interests, and we genuinely want the characters to succeed. The office makes the boring interesting, and the ordinary extraordinary. It's as if this show is telling us that if we just look around, we can find humor and love and happiness right here in our day-to-day lives, in the daily grind to which we are so apathetic. But isn't that kind of the point?",DunderMifflin,1385445080,semperpee,10,54,True,2013-11-26

In the episode ""The Secret"" in Season 2 Angela confidently and quickly asserts she would rather be with Roy rather than Jim.

"If you hated Season 9, re-watch it again, and add context.","So the wife and I always watch a lot of Office around the holidays.  This year we really went all out though, and we have (in the span of just a couple of weeks) just re-watched *every single episode chronologically*.  

Since the series just ended this year, this is of course our first time getting to do this, end to end, premier to finale.  I must say, it changed my opinion about the last season (the last two seasons, really), tremendously.  

When the last two seasons were airing, we were already super fans, so not only were our expectations extremely high, but we would also frequently go back and watch older episodes during the seasons, causing a lot of back-and-forth watching, where you lose a ton of context about the characters and their motivations over time.

In the moment as the shows were airing, post Michael Scott, the Office really didn't do it for us the way we wanted it to.  We thought they took all the characters to bad places, that they made terrible decisions (Andy as boss instead of Dwight, Jim and Athlead), and generally we weren't a fan despite continuing to watch devoutly.

Having now seen the entire run in a compressed timeframe though, I have a much, much higher opinion of the show and its last few years.  Our basic thoughts on some things we didn't like at first but ended up falling in love with:

* Andy as boss (season 8)

When Andy takes over as boss in Season 8, he is basically just Michael Scott, and it's actually pretty enjoyable.  The stuff in the office is very much as it was with Michael, and Andy really plays that dynamic, but the strongest thread in the season is Dwight and Jim's arc.

* Andy as boss in Season 9

The weird thing is that Andy as Boss are effectively two totally different things in season 8 and season 9.  The reason for this I think is his leave of absence to film the Hangover 2 or 3, aka the extended 'yacht trip'. The writers knew this was coming, and they couldn't keep making Andy into a Michael Scott-esq boss that is ultimately doing a pretty good job.  You can't just have a character you like leave for that long.  So they changed him, and they turned Andy into a terrible boss.  This is kind of jarring, but ultimately works out for the best, serving to be basically a season-long set up for Dwight to finally take the job.  On the first pass, I was angry at the writers for not giving it to Dwight originally since he gets it in the end anyway, effectively 'wasting' two years of our time.  When you actually watch it though, this time does not feel wasted, and the payoff if anything is that much greater when Dwight finally takes the job from Andy, who by that point is a full-on villain on the show.

* Jim and Pam and Brian and Athlead

This was the stuff that was hardest for us to take as it unfolded.  We really thought they damaged the Jim and Pam relationship with this stuff.  But again, watching it unfold rapidly instead of drawn out over months, you realize how much lighter the drama here really is.  They never transgress on each other significantly, the feelings they are conveying seem genuine and justified, and in the end the payoff of Pam's hugging Jim back in the Valentine's episode becomes the single greatest Jim and Pam moment on the entire show - which is saying something.  As much as I hated Brian and Athlead, they were what drove that moment, and it could't have happened without them.  


Sorry for writing a book but the TLDR is this:  If you thought the writers screwed the pooch on the Office, or that the last two seasons sucked, or just generally feel negative about the show, you should give them another shot.  Go ahead and watch the whole series again but keep on going after Michael leaves.  He was irreplaceable, but the show that kept on was worthy of its name.


Edit: 

I did think of something I truly hated about Season 9 though and I gave it its own thread! http://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/comments/1t1a4l/the_real_worst_part_of_season_9_and_the_real/",DunderMifflin,1387227248,Kiggsworthy,6,5,True,2013-12-16
"The real worst part of Season 9, and the real victim. AKA, Will ""The Farm"" go down as the worst episode of The Office in history?","The worst part: Dwight's family  
The victim: Dwight.

I just did this thread about re-watching Season 9 (after also watching 1-8) and really liking it a lot more than I did when it aired (thread here: http://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/comments/1t1828/if_you_hated_season_9_rewatch_it_again_and_add/)

That said though, and this didn't occur to me until after posting, that Season 9 did have one thing that, *especially* in retrospect, really sucked balls: Dwight's stapled-on 'family'.

I guess the network was seriously considering a 'Shrute Farms' spinoff (which, god damn, that is a TERRIBLE IDEA) and these episodes existed to kind of set up that spinoff.  One episode in particular is practically a Schrute Farms pilot episode disguised as an episode of the office - 'The Farm'.

In these episodes, we meet Dwight's (young and attractive!) brother and sister (surprise!) and they inherit a farm and they just spent a ton of time setting up these characters and the idea that they will all move back and live with Dwight and run a farm.  

In the absence of the spinoff actually existing, this is probably the worst episode of the Office, ever. Period.  It barely has any office characters, the ones it does have are effectively sabotaged by the existence of these new ones that have never been mentioned and yet are clearly close important family members.  Also how ridiculously obvious was it that the brown kid with glasses was a clear ripoff of Manny from Modern Family.

This episode will only increase in feeling out of place as time goes by.  I can't even imagine what a new fan to the series, years from now, will think of it upon encountering it.  It simply makes no damn sense at all, and again it really screws Dwight pretty badly in a lot of ways if you ask me.

Does anyone else think that in retrospect this episode is probably the worst in the entire run? ",DunderMifflin,1387228514,Kiggsworthy,12,0,True,2013-12-16

It's dead at night, everybody has left and Michael is outside in the car park. Michael starts walking to the office lobby but turns away. He takes a couple of breaths and tries again, but again he turns away saying ""No no no no"" (Like when Toby couldn't enter the church in the christening episode). It cuts to a talking head of Michael outside the office. (When you read, read in Michael Scotts voice, with the appropriate pauses) Michael: ""You know what. I've said goodbye to the place and while I don't get to go inside or see the people anymore, I've got the memories of one of the best parts of my life. And no one can take that away from me."" Michael turns and leaves but he steps in the face print he made years earlier, he looks back at it, chuckles to himself and then continues walking.

Andy's Final Monologue Makes Little Sense Coming From Him,"The only thing I didn‚Äôt entirely buy was one speech: the final monologue of Andy Bernard.

What I couldn‚Äôt buy was his nostalgia: unlike Jim and Pam, his years at the paper company were almost pure misery. He was cuckolded by Angela. His relationship with Erin soured; then he was forced to watch her fall in love in front of him. But, more importantly, he wasn‚Äôt, in fact, loved by his colleagues, who became his embittered employees‚Äîthey‚Äôd hated and resented him. At best, they pitied him.

Is this a mess up by the continuity of the script or am I missing something. Anything short of Angela paying off the doctor or the lab messing up the test, then the doctor should not have lied to Dwight when he said he wasn't the father?",DunderMifflin,1369329824,dave32891,3,2,True,2013-05-23

How the Scranton Strangler situation should have played out,"So last night I was laying in bed thinking about how the writers handled the whole Scranton Strangler business and thought of a plot that would have been really good I think,
So the last season of the Office Toby would spend it trying to figure out who the Scranton Strangler is, it would slowly become his main plot, so Toby keeps searching and deduces that the Strangler works in DunderMifflin and Toby slowly goes through each character to figure out if they are him, which could lead to funny moments like if Kelly were to catch him spying on her and she uses him to get back at Ryan. 
So Toby searches and searches and begins to believe Creed is the Strangler cause who wouldn't? But he doesn't call the cops until he gets proof but every night Creed slips out at 11 and loses Toby every night until the last episode when it is revealed that Creed actually goes to High School parties every night.
At the last episode it shows Kevin being well spoken and getting into a taxi saying there's nothing left in Scranton for him then a black screen appears and says Kevin Malone is currently wanted for 6 murderers in Pennsylvania. Yep turns out Kevin is the Strangler. Now I know Kevin would be a lot less loveable if the audience knew he killed people at night but I think it would have been really interesting way of wrapping up the whole Strangler situation, sorry if this was long

Just watched the finale,"So I put off watching the finale because I knew that it was going to make me emotional because I'm a guy so I must hate all emotion. On a more serious note, I have followed this show since season 2, and it is responsible for helping me get through high school. I struggled with a lot of personal issues during my 4 years, especially my sophomore year, and the one thing that I knew I could look forward to every night was that I could watch The Office on my iPod. I am not joking when I say that I have every episode from seasons 1-5 absolutely memorized. Watching the finale I couldn't help but cry because it really was the perfect end to the perfect show for me. Sure there were a few episodes I didn't love, and some parts that I didn't particularly care for, but as a whole this was one of the best shows I have ever seen, and think that I ever will see. The finale brought out a lot of emotion and memories for me and I really could not have asked for a better end. I'm sorry that this isn't better formatted or worded but I'm literally typing this as the video ended and I just had to say something. ",DunderMifflin,1370834424,[deleted],1,4,True,2013-06-09

Just finished season 9 (I know I'm late to the game). My thoughts.,"First off, loved it. Absolutely loved season 9 and has to rank as one of my favourite seasons. 

If there was one word to describe season 9 in my opinion it would be **bold**(I think Pam would approve of that joke). I thought having Jim and Pam have some real marriage problems was a really great thing to do, but also risky. I kind of knew in the back of my mind that they were never going to split up, but still, I was very worried in the back of my mind.  

I love how they bought Michael back as well. I thought it was perfect. It wasn't overdone, it was perfect in my opinion. And when Pam said that Michael had to have two phones to fit the pictures of all his kids on it, I nearly shed some man tears. 

I actually really liked the new guys. I though Pete was similar to Jim but also had his own qwerks, and Clark I thought had a really funny sense of humour to pretty happy with the new editions. 

One thing that kinda ticked me off was Erin and Andy's relationship. So much was built up to those two getting together, and then it just ended and my feelings towards Andy kinda went from slightly annoying, to I really don't like this guy. 

I'm really sad The Office has ended but I also feel that it's better to go out strong, and I think the show really achieved that. I think The Office is a dying breed of TV comedy and it's a real shame. Every re-run of The Office I love it even more and just a fantastic show that's been awesome to watch, and will be awesome to watch again and again.

So when should we start? And how many episodes per week should we watch? I was thinking that we could start next week(Mon 17th) and watch an hours worth of episodes every week from then on. So someone creates a discussion thread on next Monday for the first three episodes of season 1 and then everyone just discusses the episodes for the rest of the week.

"Hey, guys. I'm a newcomer to the series, and here's what I think so far. (Spoilers-ish until Season 3, Episode... 15? 18?)","So, right now, I'm up to Season 3, episode... 15, I believe? I'm so lazy that I can't even Google the proper name of the episode. Anyway, I'm on the episode about Roy's jetskis or whatever, you know, when they go to Poor Richard's, and Michael, Dwight, Jim, Karen (?) are at the CFO's party. Yeah, that one.

I'll tell you what I think so far, in an EXTREMELY condensed, bare-bones analysis. I could probably write a small novel about the series as a whole (until now), but I'll just stick to the main points, here.

One of the main points that I watch the show for is... well, for the progression of Jim and Pam. I cannot deny that, I'm absolutely infatuated with their relationship (and John Krasinski is super-adorable and easy on the eyes, so.. duh). I cried a little bit when Pam said ""I can't"" to John confessing that he was in love with Pam. It broke my heart when I saw him tear up when he confessed and she said no.

The characters are usually quite amazing as well. The major change that I've come across in the series is the absorption of the Stamford employees. Dear lord, how I hated them. I really didn't want them to join Scranton because I felt like the Scranton branch had their own dysfunctional-family dynamic going on; their hate for one another bonded them, in some way, and I felt like new employees with new quirks would ruin the vibe of the show that I adored so much. I didn't give up, though, obviously, and kept watching until only Karen was left.

Karen is an exception, though. I... hate Karen. I really hate her. For one, she seems a little 'too perfect' and 'too pretty' to be Jim's girlfriend. I feel like her humor is very put-on, forced, and fake; the actress herself doesn't do a great job of convincing me that she's a real person being documented in her life - she's the only one I get the 'acting' vibe from. She's the only character that has provoked a major dislike out of me. Otherwise, I'm cool with the characters and everything seems to be going well.

I also adore the humor: Both of my parents don't like the show and therefore I never really... encouraged (?) myself to get into the show, nor did I really ever have the chance. They always wrote the humor off as being 'too try-hard and over-the-top', but the second I watched the Pilot episode, I was in love with the subtle, awkward, dry humor. It feels very human and real and there's this staunching tension/atmosphere created by the dialogues that is extremely relatable. I have no clue how the arrangement worked out so perfectly, but I'm glad it did.

So, yeah, that's what I think about the show so far. Sorry if this was too long, but I had to share my thoughts! :D Any input? ",DunderMifflin,1353718494,[deleted],8,11,True,2012-11-23
"What long running mysteries do you hope they reveal this season, and what do you think the answers might be?","Personally, I'm just hoping that they stick to their promises of revealing the scranton strangler (Who may be bob vance?) and also explaining why they've been filming everyone for so long.

Just noticed something about the theory of Gabe being the Scranton Strangler,"Sorry I don't have a video, but if you watch the episode ""Michael's Last Dundies"", with about 45 seconds left, there is some evidence against Gabe being the strangler. Toby is up on the stage and when he mentions the scranton strangler case, Gabe sits forward and seems to be very interested...just some food for thought.

Season 2/3 Goof?,"Not sure if this has been posted before, but did anyone notice that in S2E6 ""The Fight"" that Michael talks about his best friend coming in late and having dentist appointments that arent dentist appointments (obviously referring to Dwight's ""Crentist"" appt), but neither of those events had occurred yet? 

Michael's direct quote is: ""I'm friends with everybody in this office. We're all best friends. I love everybody here. But sometimes your best friends start coming into work late and start having dentist appointments that aren't dentist appointments, and that is when it's nice to let them know that you could beat them up.""

S2E8 ""Performance Review"" is the episode where Dwight comes in late at the end of the episode because that's the episode where Jim &amp; Pam mess with him all day because he mixes up what day it is. It's also the episode where he tries to get his raise, and uses the fact that he's never been late as a talking point in the meeting with Jan &amp; Michael.

So, Creed's birthday comes before Meredith's because presumably they wouldn't celebrate her birthday twice.

So, Creed's birthday should have came before Meredith's in that early episode.

Season 9: Thoughts from a longtime fan. ,"I really feel like this season has a lot to live up to, almost an unrealistic amount of things to live up to in a lot of fans minds.

I also feel like this whole Scranton Strangler thing is getting way out of hand and it's just a little bonus the writers are throwing in to keep us interested in what's happening.

A theory as to why Andy has reverted back to his season 3 douchiness. ,"I'm not sure if this has been mentioned before, but I have a theory as to why Andy has reverted back to his season three douchiness in season nine. I'm also drunk so maybe I'm in a drunken stupor but we shall see...

I think that the wall Andy punched in seasons three and eight are his transformation points. From the moment Andy is introduced in season three, he is a major douche. He is quick to anger and doesn't seem to really care about much except himself and getting on great with Michael (after the merger) so he can have more power in the office. And then Jim decided to prank Andy for being the annoying twat that he is in season three and the famous ""Andy punches the wall"" scene is born. We see a transformation into the Andy we know very well; a kind hearted, goofy, (mostly) lovable guy. From his return in season three until the end of season eight, we really get to know this guy as the goofy son of a bitch that he really is. 

Season eight expands on this (though most of the time, you really don't care about his character because it gets rather annoying. EXAMPLE: Andy make boo boo and Jim fixes problem). During the ark where Andy goes down to Tallahassee to bring Erin back to Scranton, Nellie decides to take over as branch manager. When Andy returns, he is furious because he lost his job to someone who wasn't qualified to it and Robert California wouldn't do a damn thing about it. Andy punches the same wall he punched in season three out of anger and thus a transformation has, again, occurred. From ""Angry Andy"" through the season eight finale, he is rather depressed and tries to get his job back with the help of David Wallace, and you start to see some of his douchiness return.

Queue season nine: he's back to his season three ways. With no one to impress with Michael gone, he's even more self-centered and even more of a dick than he was in season three. Defeating Robert California and winning his old job back may have boosted his confidence and his ego, but I feel like he wouldn't have done any of this without punching the wall. The Andy we are all familiar with wouldn't have just gotten up and left Erin like he has, making the whole ""get the girl"" ark seem like a waste of time. I am under the impression that if he had never punched that wall, he may not be on that boat, and that he might still be the Andy we are all familiar with. 

Again, I'm drunk, so I may be completely delusional and just thinking crazy, but right now it makes absolute sense to me.

tl;dr the wall Andy punches transforms him from being a douche to not being a douche, and then punching the wall again turns him from not being a douche into being a douche.",DunderMifflin,1355714571,beatlerevolver66,7,16,True,2012-12-16

i just need to vent a little bit,"I consider myself a huge fan of the office. I absolutely love the series but I stopped watching it about a year ago when the show began to lose that magic feeling it gave me. However, over the past few days of my winter break, I started watching the office again. I picked up where I left off, which was a few episodes into season 8, and finished the season (Netflix doesn't provide season 9 episodes yet).

After watching season 8, I was thoroughly disappointed as to how the show has changed.

First of all, the character Nelly made me furious. She had no purpose in the story line, and the way that she was introduced and integrated into DMI was poorly done.

Secondly, I do not like how the number of expletives used by the characters has suddenly increased in season 8. It felt like the number of expletives in season 8 alone may rival the number of expletives in the rest of the seasons. The infrequent cussing in previous seasons made it special because they were rare and unexpected. Now they are trying to use it to force laughs, but it just comes off as distasteful and untrue to some of the personalities that the characters have built up in the last 7 seasons.

Lastly, I do not like story line that the season has ended with. Maybe it was just me, but season 8 has made me empathize dearly with Andy for getting his job taken away by an idiotic stranger. And to not have that full catharsis at the end of the season really left me unsatisfied with a bad taste in my mouth. And finding out that Nelly will stay in the office in season 9 after what she did seems like just a bad call by the writers. I also absolutely hate the idea that Andy breaks off with Erin in season 9. They finally got together after seasons of wrong timing and they break it off? That's like the equivalent of Ross and Rachel not ending up together in the end of Friends. Maybe I shouldn't have read ahead about season 9.

I know that everyone has already been saying that the office hasn't been the same since Michael left. Maybe I watched the episodes too late at night, and the show isn't as bad as I am making them out to be. But I really don't feel that it had to become the mundane show that it has become. I wish they had kept the office as a heart warming comedy that would always cheer up my day.

tl;dr: watched season 8 for the first time, hated it.

All the post-Michael Scott Chaos is Jim Halpert's fault,"Jim would have been the most obvious choice for manager from the start. But even more blatantly after the whole Co-Manager musical chairs, where Jim actually was already briefly manager. And its worth pointing out that this was at Jim's own initiation when he talked to David Wallace about promoting Michael, and making Jim branch manager. So originally Jim WANTED to be manager. But when Sabre takes over, he turns it down for the big sales commissions.

So basically all the crazyness and chaos, in the Office since Scott left is directly traceable to Jim turning down the offer of Manager. Based on Jo Bennett's conversation with Jim where she says she really hopes he would reconsider, its implied that Jim probably would have been Jo's first pick. 

IF Jim had just taken the Manager job after Scott left, there never would have been DeAngelo and Dwight as manager. Or the open competition which brought in Nellie and Robert California. And no Andy Benard as manager. 

So basically Jim let the Office go to hell, for his fat paycheck.  To paraphrase Jim ""say what you will about Michael Scott, he would never do that"".",DunderMifflin,1355774479,firerobin88,5,0,True,2012-12-17

How The Office Should End/Scranton Strangler,"A lot of people think that Toby will be revealed as the Scranton Strangler, including me. With that in mind, I think it would be fitting if the following things happened that support the Toby/Scranton Strangler theory:

Since in the last episode, Nellie and Toby finally kiss and presumably get together. Since Nellie is desperate to be a mom, she and Toby hurriedly get engaged/married or whatever (at this point I would like to remind everyone that Nellie once said ""My friends said if I came to America, I'd be murdered""). 

Later it is revealed that Nellie is still legally married and has a long, estranged husband that comes back after being served divorce papers, and he's angry (personally I think it would be hilarious if this long lost hubby was played by David Tennant, because I'm also a Whovian). Anyway, nellie's not-yet-ex comes to find Toby and now they have it out in a fight. 

With the new love from Nellie and the supposed Scranton Strangler behind bars, Toby has the extra courage to openly fight back. This all takes place in the parking lot, reminiscent of the Andy/Dwight duel. In the struggle, Toby gets Nellie's husband in a grip and ATTEMPTS TO STRANGLE HIM, like he's done so many times before. Everyone in the office sees this and it all becomes clear now.

Gona miss the office. Got a question too.,"The office was a tv series that was always there but I tend to avoid since I thought it was very lame, way way before when I was in high school.

Only recently, June of 2012 I started to watch it backwards, from season 8 till 1. It was a bit confusing but I enjoyed ever second of time, and laughed so much, especially when micheal Scott was there. Damn, I hated Steve carrel so much after knowing that he left by choice.


Anyways, I got two questions.
One is, there was this episode that I didn't watch yet because I don't know which me was it. It's an episode when that office was decorated with Indian/Arabic decor at the reception side. Any idea which one was that?


Also I am looking for a new comdey series to laugh at, something with the same theme or kind of comedy. The kind of awkward, stupid and positive in it. A friend of mine told me to check out raising hope, but I am on it.

"My theory on why we first hated Season 8, then loved it after starting Season 9. (spoilers)","The Office S1 to S7's comedic charm was based on the cringe-ness that Michael Scott brought to the show. After Michael moves to Colorado, the show started to phase into the traditional comedic style of 'funny situations'. Initially, we rejected it.

* This isn't the usual type of comedy we're used to! Where's the cringe moments?!

Hell, even I was in the boat that shouted, ""WTF happened to The Office!?""

Alas, Season 8 ended and Season 9 came, and we expected the worst.

But we were wrong. Season 9 is *hilarious*. Every episode is almost better than the next, and we kept thinking, ""Wow.. this is refreshing. I wonder what happened to Season 8..""

I, like many, started watching Season 8 again on Netflix, and, for some strange reason, *it's actually good*. You shouted,

* This isn't the Season 8 I remembered! 

But it is. You just weren't used to it. Little by little, the genius writers of The Office mellowed out the cringe and added traditional comedy, and it works. They knew they couldn't keep the cringe moments after Michael left, because Michael *was* the cringe. He was such a strong contrast to the rest of the crew, and expecting it to stay was foolish.

So there you have it. Seasons 1 to 7 were cringe, S8 was cringe -&gt; traditional comedy, and S9 is full blown comedy.

Who is Creed Bratton?,"So I had an idea while watching Crime Aid (Se5:Ep5) where Creed made the statement, ""No one steals from Creed Bratton and gets away with it. The last person to steal from me, disappeared. His name; Creed Bratton.""

Of course, it's a great joke, but what if, with all the ridiculous things that character has said about himself, he's actually telling the truth? So I thought, with the help of the wonderful subreddit, that we could compose a list of all the ridiculous things Creed has said and really see the true, twisted nature of one of this series best characters!

Each quote will be grouped by Season, Episode, and if possible, a time-stamp to allow other redditors to easily find the quote for themselves. This way we'll all be able to weigh in on every quote and offer insight that others may have not thought of. Ill try to include every submission in the full list, with credit given to the redditor that offered it first. 

The formatting may be very shoddy (i'm not the best at it) but i'll continue to try to clean everything up as this progresses. Please feel free to post insights or ways to make the explanations for quotes more simple.

It's sad that they had to push for Season 9. Losing Toby and Kelly, and minimizing Jim, Andy, and Dwight (who will be working on the spinoff, I assume) will really hurt the show. Not nearly as much as Catherine Tate becoming full-time, though. God, she is insufferable. Its like the producers said ""She is possibly the most hated character in the history of the show, lets make the show revolve around her now. That will boost ratings.""

Is Rainn Wilson also cutting back to film the Dwight spin-off? How is this show gonna function?

Kevin is no longer funny and is just dumb, Angela is ok, Oscar too. I see no point in Meredith. Creed is Creed and awesome as hell. I HATE Phyllis. Stanley is funny in his own way. Toby is still alright but really, what is he for other than to be abused by Michael? I still like him though.

Who is to blame for the downfall of The Office?,"Season 8 of The Office rapidly declined in both rating and popularity. Fans and critics both attribute to this downfall due to the fact that Michael Scott (Steve Carrell) left the show in season 7. However, is that left to blame or is the true reason of the downfall of The Office due to the screenwriters?

Think about it.
Even though the show became less comical when Michael Scott left, in previous seasons, the show was still funny even when Michael Scott wasn't in the scenes. However, people just say that The Office isn't funny due to the *sole* fact that Michael Scott left.

The office fan theories,"I was recently reading some stuff in /r/fantheories and came across this post about the Office and that Toby died in Costa Rica when he broke his neck and his twin brother took his job to try and defraud the company. (Here is the post in question) http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/ui3ul/toby_from_the_office_died_in_costa_rica/



While it was quite the interesting read, It seemed abit overthought, with not enough evidence to back it up, particularly debunked by the fact you actually see Toby in hospital, and I don't remember hearing about a twin brother.



The theory hints that he started wearing glasses after he came back from Costa Rica which he never did before, he also called himself Tony when introduced to someone


I also saw some theory about that everyone in the office is a patient in a mental asylum, One about Michael being the master-mind behind the documentary being filmed there, another about Michael imagining that all these crazy things happen in the Office where as it's in reality just a normal boring office with boring people



Anyhow I just wanted to ask is there any interesting/fun things you you'reself have come up with or somewhere on the net you have read about the Office, anything from Scranton strangler to Creed is Jesus reincarnated

Not that bad...,"Just finished watching the whole eight seasons. I have heard the eighth season being bashed left and right because of Nellie's addition to the show. Honestly I didn't think that the eighth season was as bad as i have heard and read. 

Sure it kind of sucks now that Steve Carell has left the show, but the other actors seem to be living up to their standards. Now that Andy is back as the regional manager, hopefully Nellie will have a lesser character plot than she did in the last part of season eight. My favorite couple of episodes are 14-18, where some of the gang take the trip down to Florida. 

I am definitely looking forward to the return of The Office when season 9 premieres on September 20th. It will be a very long wait as i blew through the first eight seasons in like 2 months. Hopefully NBC will not disappoint us when the spin-off with Dwight on The Farm premiers, apparently, in early 2013. Also, i am rooting for Andy and Erin's relationship. I hope the writers keep them together.

Have a good week everyone.

A Revelation that makes me feel stupid.

I have watched this episode at least ten times and I've always thought that he purposefully showed up one day early to make a point and to ask David Wallace really loaded questions that made him look good. Right before the theme music starts, he says something along the lines of, ""I know this company and the other managers are idiots. Pam, I'm gonna be late I forgot the day of the interview."" That should have been a giveaway but with my theory I thought he was just getting out of being late.

How would you fix the Office?,"There's no question the show's hurting. It's not a Michael thing either--it's been heading downhill for a few years. Hell, there's a thread on this subreddit about which character you'd most like to see disappear!

Here's an easy first step: eliminate the unfunny. Gabe is easy, some people seem to like James Spader's character. But the former's a simple but important move for a guy that drains the life out of at least a scene a week.

Second, reintroduce a linear storyline. Make us care again like we did in seasons 2 and 3. Jim and Pam having another baby doesn't count. These characters are pretty much standing still. In no relationship is everything so solid for so long. The writers seem set on happier ever after. That's only one idea.

Third, let Craig Robinson be funny. The guy is the second biggest star on the show after Ed Helms, but he's been such a downer between his lack of motivation at his job and his parenting situation. These are important parts of his character, but he needs to let loose.

Fourth, bring Todd Packer back every once in a while. He doesn't need to be as overt as in ""Todd Packer"", but if comes in to a party for a scene or pranks the office again, he'll have served his purpose for a season. The show has been missing someone to make the rest of the cast feel awkward.

Fifth, turn all the characters down a notch. Do we need Gabe dancing in full Lady Gaga gear? It might be Halloween, but that was absurd. Take Kevin back down from full retard. Dwight's character has been taken too far.

None of this is going to replace the charisma or the intense awkwardness that Steve Carell left behind (although I'd bet Jim Carrey could've have done a good job and helped his career--but that's another story), but they're a start.

So what would you do? Do you agree or disagree with me?

"Between the absence of Michael, Dwight spinning off, &amp; Kelly either leaving or having reduced presence due to Mindy Kaling's new Fox show, it might be time...","I'm going to be honest and say I'm not loving this season. Liking, yes. There have been some clever jokes and James Spader is great as Robert California. But overall it's been meh, and there haven't really been any interesting story arcs to speak of. 

Now, I was willing to give the show some time to find its groove again. Losing a star like Steve Carell is going to make things less impressive in comparison. So I was considering just waiting things out until next season to see if the show could regain its footing. But with this news that Rainn Wilson is probably going to leave the show for a Schrute Farms spinoff (which I would watch) and Mindy Kaling potentially getting a series over at Fox, I think it's time to just let The Office go quietly into that good night.

The show without Michael is one thing. But the show without Michael and Dwight? It just doesn't feel right. And Kelly brings some of that needed attitude to the show, not to mention the Mindy Kaling-written episodes have been some of the funniest. So if these new developments happen before the fall season, I hope NBC does the right thing.

I still think Gabe is the Scranton Strangler....[spoilers from last week],"we all know Toby is convinced that they sent an innocent man to jail while he was on ""J. Duty"".


in last weeks episode, Gabe makes a point to say how he thinks a hospitals maternity ward is great because it mixes pure joy with terrible pain and misfortune. towards the end of the episode, before Dwight finds out he may be the father of Angelas child, he asks Oscar where Gabe is and Oscar says ""i dont know, i think he went to go get something from the car.

SO, my theory (and it's a stretch, but i cant rule it out) is that Gabe got so caught up in the emotions of the maternity ward that he had to quench his insatiable urge to go out and strangle someone. And he did just that, im expecting another victim to be announced next episode, no one from the main cast obviously....but i think it's going to happen.


shows like this dont just drop subtle hints like Toby saying they got the wrong guy, i know its going to resurface.

Kathy Kathy Kathy (discussion/analysis) [SPOILERS],"(I know this is a bit of a read, but if you're up for some open discussion on the possible prospects of the final scene of tonight's episode, this is the place.)

Oooh boy. We've got a lot going on with this one. First, let me start by saying I wasn't even aware her name was Kathy. Gotta side with Dwight on her ability to hardly be noticed. You see her occasionally in the background of scene, wonder if that's really her, and then forget what she's even doing on the show still.

Ok, so now she's a member of the Tallahassee Crew and her phone call to who knows (her mother? best friend? angela?) was obviously pretty revealing. In case you missed it, Kathy, (Pam's temporary replacement) made a secret phone call to someone in the final scenes of tonights episode, supposedly expressing her desire to be with Jim on an upcoming group trip to Florida, stating, amongst other things, ""We'll get bored. What else is there to do for 3 weeks?"" Looks like the cat's out of the bag, and Pam's suspicions were actually right all along--seems she does have a thing for Jim, or at least some motives for being with him.

Before I go any further, consider this. Maybe the whole phone conversation was a deterrent, a red herring of sorts, and really her intentions with Jim are decent. Maybe it has something to do with a job opportunity or some project she needs help with. ...But really? For the scene to be shown at the bonus, after plot's been rapped up segment, and so sneakily as well, surely this will lead to a big plot point for the show. Considering that, we really have one of two major options playing out...

Option 1: **Kathy tries to seduce Jim and fails.** Kathy gets closer to Jim on the trip, they get to know each other better, she propositions him, and he refuses. This would most likely result in a denouncement of her character (literally and figuratively), her leaving the show, and Jim being shown as yet again a decent guy with solid morals. Hardly nothing more will come of it.

Option 2: **Kathy attempts to seduce Jim and they end up kissing/sleeping together.** She flirts with Jim, Jim innocently flirts back, one thing leads to another, Jim questions his relationship with Pam, and ends up having an affair of sorts with Kathy. This would completely wipe Jim's moral clean slate not just with Pam, but that of his character throughout the entire series. Maybe even lead to a divorce of arguably the best couple of the show. We would no longer be able to think of the character Jim in the same light that we used to. Granted, Jim was never some shinning hero of moral values, but generally he was a guy you could count on to do the right thing in difficult situations, pranks and all. Once this happens, though, there's no going back. 

Now you see why I bothered to type up half an essay on the subject. **The ramifications of Option 2 playing out and its impact on the show as a whole is almost immeasurable.**

So, any thoughts? Maybe I'm missing something, and there is a third (or even a fourth??) way this could play out. I'd really like to hear what other people's thoughts are on this potentially series-shaking plot turn!",DunderMifflin,1328843083,okayyeah,79,26,True,2012-02-09

Has anyone else noticed? (An honest discussion),"Just to get this out of the way: I am a HUGE fan of The Office. I have seen every single episode a number of times and continue to watch the new ones every week. The deadpan expressions and lines are my kind of humour. The show has near perfect comedic timing that just can't be replicated by the average sitcom (mainly those with a laugh track).

That being said...yes, I have noticed that (as most of you have probably noticed) the show's quality has suffered a bit in comparison to the earlier seasons (since about the end of season 5). Most shows do go through this as the audience's perception and expectations of the show are based on the first episodes that they've seen; any deviation is seen as a bastardization of the show. However, I noticed something that may or may not be a coincidence.

As everyone knows, Parks &amp; Recreation was created by Greg Daniels (co-creator of The Office (US)) and Michael Schur (producer on The Office). The series premiered in the beginning of 2009 and has been sharp and funny (more or less) since it debuted. Which brings me back to The Office:

The Office's fifth season was ending around the time that Parks &amp; Recreation started. Is it that Greg Daniels and Michael Schur are now focusing more on Parks &amp; Recreation as there is more to develop, leaving The Office in the dust? Yes, The Office still has its good moments, but its consistency has been questionable the past couple of years. I would love to hear /r/dundermifflin's input on this!

Story pitch for a Creed / Jim episode,"It was nice to see Creed have a episode as the Regional Office manager but he sure did turn up the crazy!  So here's an Idea for a Creed episode that would have us also see his home life.  

Creed and Pam would get the **A plot** well Jim and Toby would get the **B plot.**

**A plot: **

 Pam decides to make Creed a ""mission of hope""  as she thinks he needs more platonic love and caring around him.  She seeks to get to know him better and goes out of her way to engage him , causing awkward moments.  

Creed finally lets her in while she is doing something extra nice for him by spontaneously inviting her to his house for dinner.  Pam is horrified as she believes Creed to be hitting on her.  She non the less accepts  as she is committed to her ""mission of hope"" regarding this man.

As the B plot unfolds at the office with Jim we see Pam notice Creeds now over approving glares at her.

After work Creed offers for them to just take his car. Pam painfully goes though the Car ride expecting to see a old man bachelor life with according dwellings.

Instead they come up to a nice looking house in a area of similar nice houses.  They proceed to the door and as soon as Creed crosses the threshold he instantly becomes ""Normal"" and a bit delightful. He smiles at Pam and in a voice and tone she has never heard offers to take her coat.  Then his Family emerges.

He has a beautiful wife and three kids whom are home form college.  They are all very...normal and delightful! Creed introduces them as a proud husband and father.  Pam is very taken back but eases in to her own delightment. 

After the family leave to clean up / ready dinner Creed escorts Pam in to the living room with shockingly normal family pictures of Creed and his own.   As Pam sits down Creed begins to explain that when the original regional manager , Ed Truck was in charge he did his job like a pro but some ware in the middle of his tenure and just be for he hired Phyllis and Michel Creed was inline to be promoted with more responsibility but little more pay.  He reveals that he was more interested in having time for his family and he didn't want to enter a higher tax bracket!  

So he invented the Office ""Creed"" persona so that he would never be offered a promotion again.  This is why he went in to over drive Creed when he was appointed Manager out of seniority.   He informs Pam that even though his kids are in College they still need him and he still needs that time. Office Creed is till retirement! 

Creed pleas with Pam to NEVER tell any one not even Jim.  Even his own family does not know the sacrifice he has made.  

He informs Pam that the only reason he let her in on his secret is that he wanted his family to finally know he has at least one friend at the office and it mind as well be a pretty one.  

If this had come from ""Office Creed"" Pam would be a bit creeped out but having come from ""Home Creed"" she finds it endearing and blushes.  

They proceed to have a nice dinner and Pam finds her self having to make up funny / nice office stories involving a ""Home Creed"" she does not know that well.  She bumbles though and his family does not discover his secret.  

They leave the house together so Creed can drive her home and as he crosses the threshold he instantly becomes ""Office Creed"" again much to Pam's disheartenment.  


**B Plot:**

Jim is having Micheal with drawls and begins to subconsciously emulate him with his mannerisms sneaking out ,  bad jokes and strong dislike of Toby.  This comes to a head in Tobys office while Jim Berates him Micheal style.   

Because Pam cannot tell Jim about what happened at Creeds house by the end of the episode he is lead only slightly, but disturbingly, to believe that Pam and Creed have a ""thing"".  Creed is unaware of this. 

We see one final scene in the office kitchen where Pam is trying to get through to Creeds home persona.  She is mostly being unsuccessful until he stops what he's doing and for a moment looks at her as ""Home Creed"" saying  "" I had a good time"".  Then with a smile and almost immediately he says something very off the wall and walks away clearly as the good old ""Office Creed""

We end the episode with Creed in the conference room being interviewed.   He says nothing but has the warm ""Home Creed"" Smile on his face for the whole shot.

End.

I feel kind of distracted from Michael being gone every week because of everything going on...but that's the point, isn't it? Keep me entertained so I don't miss Michael. I feel like they're doing that. I see lots of potential for the remaining characters and I'm optimistic that I will really enjoy this season.

Rainn Wilson on Marc Maron's Podcast Today (11/07),"[Link to the Website](http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_225_-_rainn_wilson)

Skip to 14:30 for Rainn. I've listened to a handful of these, and while Maron can have some pretty good insight, he definitely shines in his interviews. The monologues he starts almost every show with can be a little hard to listen to sometimes with him ruminating on his alcoholism, his wife leaving him, his depression and kidney failure, and how he's afraid of everything and everyone without being that funny.

Anyway, I'm about halfway through it now. It's neat to hear Rainn talk about being an only child, the epitome of nerdiness in high school,  getting worms when he lived in Nicaragua as a kid, being raised Baha'i, and being typecasted. Unlike a few others on the show, Rainn actually doesn't change his voice/inflection much for his character, so you might have trouble not visualizing Dwight sitting in Maron's garage saying these things.",DunderMifflin,1320703041,Kostanzer,1,23,True,2011-11-07

What are your predictions for The Office post Michael Scott?

I think Michael Scott has been a great part of the show from the start, and I will miss him, but I do not think that his departure will mean the death of the show. The Office has so much potential. Just think how much the other characters have developed since season 1. I feel like I have come to know them so well and yet they have so much more to give us. I do recognise that there will be a big hole to fill when Michael is gone and I am interested is seeing how they fill that hole (that's what she said) but I have a lot of confidence in the writers that they will be able to pull it off and I am not ready to say goodbye to Dunder Mifflin Scranton just yet.",DunderMifflin,1299905389,BleeT,10,7,True,2011-03-11

_____________

Full disclosure: I didn't see the newest episode yet. My thought just comes from previous episodes. Specifically the one where Michael leaves.

I felt like Michael giving Andy the top 10 clients and Andy fixing what Deangelo caused with one of the clients, is setting him up for the manager position. I think the producers considered a big name (although Helms is pretty big now) but they decided to stay in house. Carey, Romano, Arnett, etc. are just big names trying to throw us off. I'm expecting DM to conduct interviews and that's where the big names come in. Eventually Andy will get the job.

To be honest with you I feel like that should be the end of the series. Andy takes over and fixes his desk and the camera pans across the office from behind the blinds. Then the credits roll. I'm stoked for more of the show but it would be nice to have everything wrap up here and now.

Cliffhangers are awesome sometimes but I didn't want this to end on a cliffhanger. It's a comedy and they should have just been upfront about it.

Some symbolism in Goodbye Michael?,"Towards the beginning of the episode, Michael shows his World's Best Boss mug to the camera, and mentions that he gave it to himself, and that other people gave him his World's Best Boss Dundie.  He throws the mug in the trash and then places the Dundie on the desk.

Later on when he has that minor breakdown after Oscar asks where he's moving to, he actually reaches into the desk and puts the mug back on his desk.  He then calls Holly and calms down.

I take this to represent Michael evolving from a very insecure character to a more happy, self-assured character.  His entire character has been about making friends and finding love and acceptance.  To do this he had to become narcissistic and tell *himself* how great he is.  But after he proposes to Holly and the last Dundies when everyone sings to him...he no longer has to do this.  He is no longer Forever Alone.  His character changes a bit.  By placing the mug back on the desk, this represents a revert to his old, insecure, egotistical self.  Of course his narcissistic, ~~nihilistic~~[edit: meant to say solipsistic] personality is still very strong, but he shows signs throughout the episode of thinking about others.

I looked so forward to the subtle hints to be dropped in the finale, leading the way for a major story to develop next season, working their way up to finding out whether or not they were related. They could have forged an incredible bond, and even if the tests came back negative (which we found out in merely 17 minutes) they could have had the relationship anyway.
