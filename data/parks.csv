Letter to Brendanawicz,"This guy had no chance. He started out being compared to the then beloved Jim Halpert. John Krasinski is now a huge movie star and obviously did a great job as Jim. But if you ask a British office fan, they will almost always choose Tim the original over Jim. 

Then Mark is pitted against the beloved Andy Dwyer. An extremely likeable goofball. The actor is also now a huge movie star and also nailed his character. 

Then the network brings in Rob Lowe and the amazingly talented Adam Scott. Both actors were fantastic and played very likeable characters. It's hard to argue that they didn't improve the show greatly. But the tone of the show really changed and Mark's character no longer fit very well. 

I can't blame Paul Schneider for being upset here. I really like his character when I rewatch the show. He's not nearly as funny as Ben or Chris but he brought a sense of normal that contrasted well with Leslie. He also seemed to show realistic growth as a person and I think his character could have been really interesting if the show had stayed it's course.",PandR,1571349530,RandySwango,4,18,True,2019-10-17

Star trek movies rule,"My favorite seasons are definitely 3/5/7. Season 1 I'll never watch again, Season 2 is pretty much 50/50, Season 4 I mostly groaned at, and rewatching 6 I'm not all that nuts about episodes like New Beginnings, despite little moments like Andy printing out his Minesweeper high score or Ron utterly destroying his government award at the very end.

Roger Ebert made the observation that odd numbered Star Trek films seemed to fall flat, which is a canard people ran with, perhaps unfairly - #3 isn't that bad, the first one has definite moments of cinematic majesty, that is when it isn't busy serving up things like Kirk telling hippie Bones that he needs him...badly...so, flawed but well intentioned.

A small little callback I noticed,"In Season 2 Episode 20, after Ron and Leslie attend the very horrible picnic they go to get food. In that conversation they ask if they are eventually going to hate eachother and later in that conversation Leslie asks ‚ÄúWhy would anybody eat anything other than breakfast food?‚Äù to which Ron responds ‚ÄúPeople are idiots Leslie‚Äù

Flash forward to season 7, and they hate eachother. But right towards the end of the episode where they make amends we get this exchange:

Leslie (to April): April, Ron and I are going to JJ‚Äôs to eat too much breakfast food
Ron: Why does anybody in the world ever eat anything but breakfast food?
Leslie: People are idiots Ron‚Äù

Shows VERY similar to The Office and Parks and Recreation! Help!,"I feel like I will never find shows as good as those two. They are tied as #1 on my all time favorite T.V Shows, even though I have not watched any other American TV show to its entirety. I was suggested to watch Brooklyn 99 and The Good Place. I watched most of the first season of Brooklyn 99, but it doesn't seem to have the same vibe as Parks or Office.

You see, in Parks and Office, there was some dark humor and bitter, hurtful, yet hilarious, jokes said among the characters which I adored, don't take it the wrong way. For example, (since I just finished watching Parks), everyone was mean to Blarry for like the 95% of his appearances, Ron was apathetic for a lot of the time too, and there were some intense feuds between Ron and Tammy and Leslie and that orthodontist. What I loved even more was how all of that drama was settled in the last few episodes of the last season. Even in The Office, Dwight hated Jim all throughout, Stanley hated everyone, and Michael said some harsh stuff about other characters, and all of this happily settled at the end of the show.

In Brooklyn 99, everyone seems to treat each other with respect too much (probably cuz they're all policemen). They joke around but then quickly seem to refocus on their work. Most importantly, any feud or a new and seemingly harsh inside-joke seems to end right at the end of each episode. I am not considering watching the Good Place. I already read it's synopsis of how this not-very-nice woman turns her life around to find the good person within. Sounds too much of a hero/anti-hero's journey. Half of the show would be fun for me due to the crude insults and jokes but the other half would be boring by being too philosophical and too good-hearted.

I hope I made clear what type of show I am looking for, though I don't think there is another one like Parks and Rec or the Office (unless they just do a reboot). But if anyone has a good suggestion, I would love to check it out and see.",PandR,1571877025,OfficialAnu,29,8,True,2019-10-23

"A reunion episode proposal - 20,000 Paunch Burger","I'd seriously give some thought to donating a kidney, like deep thoughts on the porch on an autumn eve with Jack Handey, like a sunset after smoking a blunt thoughts, like what are those asterisks over there thoughts, towards the Kickstarter for this P&amp;R reunion episode:

20,000 Paunch Burger

The show opens with Ya Herd with Perd. Perd comes on, does his thing, then promotes his new game show where the grand prize is 20,000 Paunch Burger, the title of the show. 'Created and Produced by Perd Hapley, that's me' he reads out loud after the video preview. 'That's right, n***a', Perd muthafuckin Hapley. Ya herd me my n****s! I own this town.' He drops the mic and walks out. The rest of the episode is the gang all coming together in Pawnee to watch the premier episode on a big screen in the town square. Everybody's there.

The last scene is a lawyer reading Leslie's will to her triplets. The lawyer realizes she's reached the final section and starts holding back tears. The lawyer stammers 'Leslie leaves her 20,000 Paunch Burger prize (she was the 5th winner, the lawyer adds) to the Pawnee Parks and Rec Department for the employees to eat. Well, 19,998 burgers to be exact. Leslie states that it was a nice day away from the kids' the lawyer says and the triplets laugh. The lawyer is looking ahead, sobbing sweetly. 'That was beautiful, so beautiful' the lawyer says to the paper. The lawyer looks up and suddenly jumps out of her chair when the contestant on 20,000 Paunch Burger wins on a silent TV behind the triplets. 'This is the most amazing day of my life!' she cries out in ecstacy. 'What a gift,' she says after she calms down. 'You guys all want to go to Paunch Burger? I really need a number 8 all of a sudden' the lawyer says after a not at all awkward silence. As they're walking out the door, the lawyer hesitates by herself for a moment, then she looks suspiciously into the camera. The camera breakes her stare and goes over to the silent TV. It has a graphic that says Congratulations. THE END.

In all seriousness, I would stop reading now if you're not comfortable with complete hopelessness. This next shit is brutal.

MADVILLAINY

The SHAME smartphone app is where people submit a bad thing you did, the company investigates and certifies it, your face is flagged in their system and then businesses report your location, homes with cameras outside them report, people just setting up in the park to keep the place clean of Shamers report, the works. If you're going to the bar, you'll know what Shamers are there and their story. A young blond white woman (The woman from The Witch) thought she was getting away with her affair but her husband had been tracking her. He paid the hotel's bribe to get the video footage. She's at a mall in a store and her phone goes off. She checks her phone and it's a face call from her husband. 'Wanted you to see it a few seconds first' he says and hangs up right after a notification says she got a video from him. It's her Shame Story, with an announcer who goes over the details of her affair showing the video of her having sex with her blurred out lover. A frenzy seizes her, she leaves the dressing room and peeks out from the entrance. She hears people getting dings on their phones. When they're done watching a video of her Shame Story, they look up towards her in disgust. When she runs out the store, she passes a rack of blouses with a red A on them, very fashionable. Now she has to deal with life post-Shame. The ratings for the sexy young blond with a sex tape went through the roof, of course, everyone and their grandma shared that Shame Story. And she was a part time model who was in a well known jeans billboard. Thats about as big as you get outside SHAME, people just don't go to movies and watch TV like they used to. They even got a nickname for her, The Garden Nymph, as she has a nice garden in her back lawn she tends to. She gets the legal cold shoulder at work. Her lover abandons her due to not wanting to be seen with a Shamer because the husband did the classic option to blur the lover's face and not Shame him in order to pressure them to break up. When she gets her hair done, other customers talk about what she did loudly. She shaves it all off. When she goes to the gym, people passing by call her names. When she watches videos on the internet, they have ads that remind her that she's a piece of shit. All this while the SHAME app puts out a news piece wondering if she'll cave in or not. In the end, she agrees to the company's terms for removing her from the Shame app: full video access to her life for the rest of her life and she has to wear a microphone wherever she goes. When she dies (they hope by suicide when she's young) the company gets her organs and her body to use in their necrophilia business. 

But first, she must give a performance at Shame Alley. 

Cameras roll, broadcasting around the world in different languages, as she's tarred (not hot) and feathered (white) and naked, her face bare, with people from her life screaming and throwing eggs at her while she struggles down the strip. At the end, her ex husband with a grin throws a bucket of red corn syrup on her then hands her a fresh apple from the ice. Close up of his suited hand exchanging the apple with hers. Close up of her eyes, with an indescribable stare, trembling, splashed with corn syrup. In an executive board room, there is an unveiling of a large, well-lit picture of the same people in the room, all male, posing with the hysterical woman. One of them compares it to the the actual picture of them. They congratulate themselves on the record ratings when their meeting is interrupted by a call from the POTUS via their secretary. The secretary says, 'He says 'Wow what a show, you're hired' and they all laugh. The close up of the apple exchange is mounted up in the entryway of SHAME Headquarters, solid gold frame.

I tried to start watching the show and made it just a few episodes in before giving up.

Can I start at season three and be OK?

Is there maybe one or two episodes of the first two seasons that I can watch and know what‚Äôs happening later? Is there a supercut that hits the high points?

Series Name: Trailblazers

Summary: After failing to become a police officer, young substitute teacher (Chris Pratt/Andy Dwyer) loses an up and coming student athlete in a largest forest in Indiana.

So where do her gift assets come from?  I think she might have been embezzling from Eagleton somehow.  Their books were already such a mess no one would ever notice.

How do you feel about the tonal shift in season 4? (Warning: long analysis),"Hello, everyone! Long-time fan, started watching the show during season 2 but have never really discussed it outside of my friend group. Recently started a rewatch and noticed just how much the show changes in season 4. Thought it would be an interesting topic of discussion. I always divided Parks and Rec in five eras: 1, 2-3, 4, 5-6, 7. But looking back , the biggest tonal shift by far happens between season 3 and season 4. I would even argue it's one of the most drastic tonal changes in comedy history, especially for a show that had already found its footing. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Some of the major changes:** 

**Content**

* Much, much less focus on the department. The only character that mainly has her storylines still linked to the the department is basically April. Ben quits, Tom has Entertainment 720, Leslie has her campaign, Ron either supports Leslie or is paired with Chris and Andy gets side storylines. There are only couple episodes where we see Parks work in the focus. 
* Much more focus on Leslie. Before season 4, Leslie still is the main character and she gets the main story almost every episode but Season 4 still feels like placing a way bigger focus on Leslie. This probably boils down to the fact that none of the other characters, save for Tom and Chris, get major character-changing storylines. Campaign is still Leslie's (and Ben's) story and given that it's the only main storyline of the season, everyone else gets shafted a bit. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Characters** 

* Everyone becomes much more grounded, grown up and less weird. Notably April, Andy and Tom - the show's more immature characters. Their more negative characteristics become character quirks rather than butt of the joke. Don't get me wrong, this starts earlier, but the change is still noticeable.
* Everyone becomes super wise and great at their job? Almost every episode characters start giving each other deep advice. Once again, this is not the first time this happens on the show. Before, Ron is the one that mostly gives profound advice because he serves as the reluctant father figure of the group but this season, everyone from April to Tom and Ann adopts this role. Also, everyone's really great at their job and enjoys what they are doing. One of the running jokes in the first seasons is that Leslie is the only one that cares about the Parks department and everyone else doesn't care or is Jerry. This REALLY changes this season and not only does everyone start caring about the department as well as Leslie's campaign but they also are all almost always good at what they do (discounting Tom and his business cause he goes back to Parks quite early in the season). You could argue that this starts with Harvest festival in season 3 but that was mostly Leslie's and Ben's work and characters caring made sense because they were close to losing their jobs. 
* Leslie becomes super mature and politics-savvy. One of the main qualities of Leslie in early seasons is that she is naive, a bit childish and awkward. Yes, she becomes much more competent in season 2 when the showrunners decided to stop her from being a Michael Scott-like character but she still retains those qualities. It's just that people close to her start appreciating those quirks of her. It's still especially difficult for her to navigate around in social situations. This really changes in Season 4 and she really ups her game as a politician. She is a great speaker, she is savvy and witty with Jennifer and she is dumbfounded by Bobby's incompetence in a way that imo season 2 or 3 Leslie would not be. She is almost never thrown off her game and when she is, she is still able to recover by the end of the episode. In addition, everyone loves her. The only way that Bobby gets ahead of her is by using his money and influence. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Style** 

* I don't know if this is just me but the show looks very different as well. Feels much less like a mockumentary and more like a regular comedy. Seasons 2-3 are shot somewhat similarly to The Office while having their own distinctive style (unlike season 1) but season 4 becomes a bit ... generic? Camera angles make it look more like Veep or other cable comedies and there are less close up shots and correct me if I am mistaken, but there are way less camera confessionals or characters interacting with the camera. 
* Coloring is different. Once again, don't know if this is just me, but the show looks more toned down. Take any character shot from season 4 and compare it to season 2 or 3 and you will immediately notice that the colors look more faded and muted. If season 2 looks more like say, Community and Glee, season 4 looks like Veep or Happy Endings. I guess it adds to the realistic feel of the season rather than the more animated style of earlier seasons but I still love the lively colors of the earlier seasons.  
* Serial storytelling. Season 3 has harvest festival but season 4 is a very tight story of Leslie's campaign. It starts with it and ends with it. There are filler episodes in between but the main story is clear. 

**Did this work?** 

I would argue that it worked and it didn't work. **Season 4 is a fantastic season of comedy and storytelling**. It is funny, smart, emotional, dynamic. The main story is fantastic, Amy Poehler is at her best and all the new characters/actors work really well. Also, the less developed characters like Chris, Donna and Ann get a lot of good moments and needed characterization. If someone told me that this was their favorite P&amp;R season, I would not be surprised. 

HOWEVER, I think **the season shifts the show to a new direction that it didn't necessarily know how to handle** and this becomes evident in the next seasons. While the show still remains funny, sweet and endearing, it becomes a bit stagnant in terms of character development. Season 4 gave characters success and happiness which was heart-warming and well-earned but in my opinion,  in the following seasons, the show fell into the trap of constantly rehashing this emotion and becoming formulaic. Everyone starts becoming more and more successful with no stop and everything works out for everyone every episode. In addition, we get almost zero conflict between characters and everyone always treats each other with incredible care and attentiveness (except for the brief fight between Ron and Leslie in season 7). I know I sound like a Debbie Downer but I feel like seasons 2 and 3 handle the heart-warming side of the show better because the warmth and care between characters feels more ... special? April telling Leslie her feelings during her wedding makes you feel emotional because it's not something April would normally do. But if she starts doing this almost every episode, then it won't have the same effect. 

My opinion is that **season 4 came too early.** The show had definitely not run out of storylines for the department, especially as it found its footing in season 2 ( with a very short season 1 and somewhat short season 3). The show should not have let Leslie run for Council for one or two more seasons and they should have continued developing office dynamics between characters in the style of season 2 and 3. In addition, they should have continued making character relationships more dynamic by creating more lasting important storylines. Andy and April didn't need to become only #COUPLEGOALS the second they got together. Same with Leslie and Ben. The show could have still brought in new conflicts and challenges for them. In addition, if season 4 happened one or two seasons later, the character growths would have felt more organic and more earned. Leslie could have matured and become more aware of politics more gradually, for example by getting a mentor of some sort (her mom or another new recurring character); April, Tom and others could have started caring more about their jobs through concrete experiences that would have tested them and their passion. I actually believe that the season 4 storyline could have been reserved for the show's final season. It would have been a great (and more realistic) ending to Leslie's story and we still could have gotten glimpses of foreshadowing that this was only the beginning of her career. 

Don't take this as me hating on the season or the show. I love season 4 and I love P&amp;R (even though I have problems with later seasons). If you disagree with my take, I would love to hear your opinions. My main goal with this post is to start an open city forum ;)",PandR,1556033833,giogugenishvili,2,9,True,2019-04-23
Ben Wyatt and The robotic Congressman,"Remember the episode where April and Ben meets the Congressman ( S5 / E4 ) Which sits and stares at a wall for an hour making Ben and April believe he might be a Robot?

6 Seasons in to Parks and Rec. Here are my thoughts.,"About halfway through Season 6 and here are my thoughts.

* For some reason I'm enjoying this more than The Office, and I was a die-hard fan of that show.
* Craig is annoying as fuck....so far.
* The acting is so good, I actually get frustrated with some of the characters lol.
* Ron Swanson continues to intrigue me and make me burst out laughing.  The bacon in the ceiling panel, and him destroying employee of the month plaque had me rolling lmao.
* I like how Tom and April have progressed, and how even tho Andy wasn't as involved in this season because of Pratt filming Guardians, the show's entertainment doesn't really suffer.

"Parks and Rec may be my favorite show, but this part makes me furious...","Every time I watch this episode I get so mad at Ben because the logic he uses to figure out this one clue makes no sense to me:

On season 4 ep 14 ‚ÄúOperation Ann‚Äù, Leslie sends Ben on a Valentine‚Äôs Day scavenger hunt. After some time Ben, Ron, and Andy end up at a JJ‚Äôs Diner to help him find the clue there. Ben reads the clue ‚ÄúNo food finer, clue 3 at JJ‚Äôs diner‚Äù. Ben determines that ‚Äúno food finer‚Äù for Leslie is whipped cream. Not WAFFLES. Whipped cream. 

Does anyone else feel like they could have written that clue in better? Yes, Leslie definitely has an obsession with whipped cream, but she seems to be more obsessed with WAFFLES. It didn‚Äôt even come up as an option! Leslie has repeatedly, and descriptively spoken so highly of WAFFLES. Granted she likes whipped cream ON or WITH things, but the star FOOD for her is so clearly WAFFLES!

Ex. 1: When Ben goes to visit Leslie in the hospital when she has the flu, he brings soup and WAFFLES. She eats the WAFFLES without even having whipped cream on them!

Ex. 2: in the episode where Jerry retires, she comes to his house with a waffle purse.

Ex. 3: When Ben and Ann are trying to find Leslie a gift for their special holidays with Leslie, they bid against each other on EBay for a WAFFLE maker. 

AND Ex. 4: (also on the Flu Season episode) when Leslie is trying to organize the Harvest Festival and invites JJ to the Chamber of Commerce meeting, JJ agrees because Leslie is his favorite customer.... because she spent over $1000 on WAFFLES alone!

I personally think that overall there was good writing and character development within Parks and Rec, but I will always be tempted to skip over that scene or the whole episode because of that one major flaw. ",PandR,1541287058,eneyesee,4,0,True,2018-11-03
Does the Show Get Better After Season 1?,"I just finished watching season 1, and... I really hate most of the characters. Ron is the worst. Tom is a dick. April seems to have no character apart from being the youngest and a teenager, and Leslie. Leslie didn't say no to dating a 60-year old man, even though she wanted to. She's so... Too naive and too gullible. I just feel so bad for her, but she's also extremely annoying. None of the characters have really gotten any development apart from Anne and Andy, and also, Anne and Leslie have way more chemistry than anyone else in the show. I mean, that part's fine, since the writers did that a different way, but I just wanted to say that.

Does it get better after season 1? I love Michael Schur's other shows: Brooklyn 99 and the Good Place, and I really want to like this one, but... I can't. And I've heard this is a great show, so I really hope that it gets better.

I WANTED TO TELL YOU THAT I HAVE JUST UPLOAD THE EXTENDED VERSIONS

OF CHAPTERS 5 AND 13 OF THE FIFTH SEASON.



AND SINCE I CREATED THIS TXT, I WANT TO SHARE SOME THINGS WITH

THE FANATICS OF PARKS AND REC.

I AM A FAITHFUL FOLLOWER OF THE SERIES SINCE THE FIRST CHAPTER. AND TO BE HONEST,

THE FIRST SEASON I WAS NOT CONVINCED AND THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD CANCEL IT IN ANY MOMENT. THOSE WHO SAW IT FROM THE BEGINNING MAY ALREADY UNDERSTAND IT,

BECAUSE IF YOU REMEMBER IT, IT SEEMED THAT THE SERIES DID NOT FIND HIS TONE.

FOR LUCK FOLLOWS AND WAS IMPROVING A LOT WITH TIME, AND CHARACTERS THEY WERE FINDING THEIR RHYTHM AND TODAY ARE SIMPLY WONDERFUL. IN REALITY I STARTED TO TRANSLATE IT BECAUSE IN THEN NOBODY  DID IT

(ARGENTEAM BEGAN IT, BUT HOW IT HAPPENS WITH MANY SERIES, THEY LEFT IT),

AND I WAS LIKE A SHAME THAT BY THE LANGUAGE MANY THEY LOSE THIS GREAT SERIES.

(EVEN THE SONY CHANNEL LEFT IT).

AND THEN I TAKEN IT AS A RESPONSIBILITY, SO THAT EVERYONE COULD ENJOY IT, ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO SAY ""THEY WAIT FOR MY SUBTITLES TO SEE IT, IS THE BEST COMPLIMENT I COULD EVER RECEIVE AND THERE ARE SO MANY MESSAGES
SO CUTE THAT MAKE ME WANT TO FOLLOW WITH THIS, BECAUSE I KNOW THAT ALTHOUGH WE ARE FEW THE FOLLOWERS, WE ARE SUPER FAITHFUL.

THERE ARE THE MOMENTS AS THE ONE THAT COMPRATES APRIL AND ANN IN THE LOT, TOM AND ANN AT THE PARTY,

AND LESLIE AND ANN AT THE END (IN THIS PART I WAS AS ANN WHEN RON SPEAKS)
THOSE WHO DO THIS INCREDIBLE SERIES. AND OF COURSE I DO NOT FORGET ABOUT ANDY, RON
AND DONNA. I LOVE!
IN REALITY MORE THAN ANYTHING I WANTED TO WRITE THIS TO THANK ALL OF THOSE WHO I WRITE THOSE THINGS BEAUTIFUL AND TO SAY THEM THAT EVEN SOMETIMES I LATE AFTER
A LITTLE BIT, MY INTENTION IS TO CONTINUE MAKING THESE SUBTITLES, BECAUSE IT IS ALSO SOMETHING I ENJOY A LOT.

AND GOOD, I LEAVE THEM BECAUSE I HAVE TO GO TO DISPOSE OF ANN, AND AFTER I SEE THEM

AT JJ'S CAFETERIA TO EAT SOME WAFFLES WITH A LOT OF CREAM.

What's your favorite episode?,"I've gone through Parks and Rec three times now, well I'm on season six but close enough to the end, and I think I've done enough research to finally say what my favorite episode is.

Well, in this case it is episodes. London Parts 1 and 2. Watching it right now I've realized that every single time I watch this on Netflix I laugh harder than I have at any other episode. So many fantastic moments.

April looks dang good.

It also drives the plot in a big way. Chris and Anne announce their pregnancy, Andy goes off to film Guardians of the Galaxy, Ben gets a large amount of corgis, Tom gets an arch nemesis, Jean-Ralphio and Mona Lisa are used to their potential.

There is no better episode than London.

I finally understand Tom and Jerry,"Like the famous cat and mouse duo, they're workplace opposites. Maybe you've worked with some Tom and Jerrys.

Tom is the entrepreneur. He's swagged out in expensive suits, constantly trying to network, and looking to build an empire.

Jerry is the everyman. He does a decent job, is nice to everyone \(despite being the butt of their jokes\), and is riding it out until retirement.

I've always been a bit of a Tom. I've spent the past 5 years living in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York starting ventures and side\-projects the whole time. I've been dead broke and I've been üé∂ FLUUUSHHH WITH CAAAAASSHHH üé∂ 

Recently, my partners and I dissolved an investment fund we started so I totally empathize with the Entertainment 720 fiasco. I've returned to my hometown, a pleasant little suburb in nowhere\-USA, to spend time with my parents. 

I don't know what I'll do next but working in a cubicle for the rest of my life terrifies me. Nothing sums up the feeling better than this:

&gt;*I guess I‚Äôm Jerry now. After work I‚Äôll just go home, straight to my boring house, kiss my wife, and have a home\-cooked meal with my three beautiful daughters. What a miserable life.*",PandR,1525405215,FailFastandDieYoung,3,9,True,2018-05-03

I can't help it but i just hate donna,"I am doing my first rewatch of Parks and Rec. One of my all-time favorite shows. It got me through tough times at the hospital about 2 years ago. But I can't help to just hate Donna.

I thought it was just the first and second season that made her seem so awful, but I am nearing the end of season 4 and I just hate her. I hated her during my first time watching and I just hate her again. 

She is obsessed with her Mercedes for no reason. When Ron got shot by Tom she goes all beserk, not because her boss was shot, but because her car window was smashes. When Tom needs help moving she allows one tiny box into her beloved car. She is just mean to most people. When Ann asks her help during the dating session she tells her to fuck off and only helps her later on. She is beyond self-centered and not even getting everyone to call Jerry Garry can save her. When Tom wants her to buy into Snakehole with him she listens and then just buys her own shares. And then Tom has to sell his share, but she gets to keep it. She doesn't stick by him, help him or anything like that. She pretty much threatens him not be a snitch. She has a cabin and refuses to tell people about it, because 'Meagles are not welcoming people' or whatever. Then she has tons of bs rules. 'You do not have access to the hot tub' or 'upstairs is Meagle only space'. Nice behavior towards your friends. 

I know the writers didn't do much with her, but that's not an excuse. Out of all the 'good guy' main cast, I absolutely despise Donna. ",PandR,1525716606,michaeltakai,6,0,True,2018-05-07

Why Parks and Rec is special: its message of hope in the face of adversity,"Watching an average of 2 episodes a day over the last two months I finally finished the series last night. I wanted to talk about and share why I think Parks and Rec is so special.

There‚Äôs a lot of good shows on television right now. But a lot of it is also grimdark. Game of Thrones showcases the brutality of war, incredible violence, and decent people living in an indecent world. Black Mirror and Westworld are both high quality cinematic and narrative experiences, but they are also a commentary on the dangers of technology, the baser instincts of humanity, and full of just good old\-fashioned [nightmare fuel](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel) \(TV TROPES WARNING!\)

Parks and Rec isn‚Äôt that. It‚Äôs the complete opposite. I think the message of the show, if there is even such a thing, is one of hope. Leslie Knope is a life preserver at a time when you turn on the news, or go on the front page of Reddit, and see corruption, greed, and callousness in our politics and way we treat each other. On Parks and Rec, the characters treat each other with respect \(sorry Larry\-\-oh\-\-I mean Garry\) and at the end of the day put aside their personal and political differences to accomplish things that benefit their community, themselves, and their friends. Much like The West Wing, the show has that same hopeful optimism that good government can and should exist. 

On the show Knope is forced to deal with ignorant citizens, corrupt and sleezy politicians, and callous and greedy companies, but she always emerges from these encounters with a sense of renewed optimism \(with a little help from Anne after she loses the recall election\). She's still that same optimistic, headstrong person from when the show started. It speaks to resilience in the face of overwhelming adversity. 

The growth of the characters over the last two seasons makes me reflect upon my own accomplishments. I‚Äôm at a stage in my life where I want to move on to bigger and better things, and I hope I can take away that same hopeful optimism for the future that was captured by the series finale.

Or just take Chris Traeger‚Äôs words as motivation: ‚ÄúThere is *literally* nothing in this world that you can‚Äôt do.‚Äù",PandR,1525796753,jbmoskow,1,26,True,2018-05-08

"A few fun pieces of lore taken from the town's website, also for some reason I can only type in caps on the title","Again, apologies for the title of this post, for some reason every letter is automatically caps-lock'ed.

- Andy accidentally submitted a Women's Studies paper to the newsletter, here it is in full 
&gt;Women. Aren‚Äôt we all women if you really think about it? Maybe. But, what about men you ask? Can a man be a woman? And, if not, what can a man truly know about a woman? The greatest woman I know, told me to always ask questions (note from Leslie: that was me!). So, I ask you, now: what is a woman? Wrong. What isn‚Äôt a woman? Guess again. Abigail Adams was married to John Adams, and was the mother of John Quincy Adams. She was a woman. Or was she? I was assigned to write about her. Was I? I don‚Äôt know. Think about it for once. Thank you. Has this been 1,000 words? I sure hope so. The assignment was to write 1000 words. One thousand! Words! So many words. So many women, so few who were married to John Quincy Adams. Makes you think. From, Andy.

- Chris details one of his visits with Dr. Richard Nygard. 
&gt; I am extremely depressed. I looked at my calendar today and realized that my favorite Sierra figs are going out of season. It was crushing. They are a digestive system‚Äôs best friend, and delicious to boot. I cannot stress enough how predictable my bowel movements are with one fig in the morning. But, as I explained this to Dr. Nygard he directed me to think of the new season. The second he said that, I screamed, ‚ÄúBeets!‚Äù Just remember: every end of one season is the beginning of another.

- Ron does not like the games ""Jenga"" and ""Sorry!"".

Comment too long for response to best theories of time Travel in TV show Promoted by HULU,"[spoiler](#s ""Final Dialog Revealed"")

The thesis that will develop painfully slowly and in a roundabout if not haphazard way - already doing just that in this sentence - is that ""Parks and Recreations"" is so personally close to it's main actor/writer/producer that the narrative in the show with its interpreted meaning impinges upon the nature of time traveling creative sorts themselves. There is a theory that is so a-scientific being put forth that it almost supports the notion in a ""say no more/say no more"" way. 

That is as if a gal came up to you and said very earnestly in this weird realm, ""I'm a time traveler and I will make a show to prove it."" But then they embodied this kind of character with the spunk of a everyday ordinary civil servant who has lots of flash forward ""action"" in the final season of the show. The flash forward is the traveling but it looks just like a plot device. Such a thesis would have to continually steer clear about over-suggestively stating the motives of the real life creators of the show as it hyper-deconstructs one some plausible time-line of the show that was aired in and fantasized about. But then later there is a more plausible admission in real life as to what the show had done via what the creator says she believes. So there is grounds to stray quite liberally in teh interpretation.

Note even after admission or acceptance or whatever, to the intents of the show creator, which only you know for sure cause you can't read minds, due to lack of phenomenological capacity to keep separate the consequences of writing to influence time and writing and reading to comprehend the affects and cause simultaneously are those consequences that have happened purportedly still problematic. This just says that it is irrelevant whether you know about time travel or how to do it in relations to actually doing time travel and succeeding at it. Our little minds get glimpses of things that are beyond them and some call it time travel and some call it the workings of the subconscious. But some call it art and some make some wild and wonderful art in the process. And their's very little to no mention of physics. It gets more messed up then this believe me. 

The person who created the show, nor you yourself however well you knew the person under this kind of mechanism, would not even be able to tell well when their beliefs became popularly accepted about time travel and when they had actually shared them as bit of future time when they were less popular. They can't admit to themselves things they will one day know regardless of how honest they may be. Some part knows either future or past selves and it does not matter which because they don't know how to know though they seemingly showed how to know. But it gets easier to understand.

True thinking about time and writing about time and sensing the future though actions like writing fiction, erg timeless fiction, are very much necessarily conceived of and understood as phenomena. But transmitting these phenomena as is when done artistically closer to an act of faith then an analytical solution to the problem of how time is traveled. So while making the art one can be in a little bubble of inspiration that avoids what one had conceived and what one would understand. All that matters is that something relevant and completely, in some bizarre worst case scenario devoid of any relevant science, gets out there. The active influence itself. 

One of that show's creators in this instance may have heavily influenced by her own extremely tame sci-fi sprinkled show her own future self's auto-biography with a main focus on time travel. That's the quasi-admission she comes unwittingly to believe and I present with my own hard edged take here by looking at the show and referencing her own work.

Unwittingly could go either way as a value judgement. Did she not know something that was a physical fact. Does she not know something that is flatly scientifically false. It can't be stressed enough that this could be all viewed through a pscyhologism of self fulfilling behaviors so the beliefs in physical mechanism are all just figments. But if it works who cares. Crassly if she gets paid why would she question herself.

Why would some person become so amazingly successful if it was just all the rage. Could not anyone make a hit show with hard work minus the time travel spin if time travel were truly nothing in this way. They're apparently faking it and fooling themselves and making the worst kind of fake art. Why furthermore would they delude themselves with so much hard work of not being confounded by being a ""time traveler."" That's quite a weight to carry if there is nothing to it especially for a non-analytical sort. But maybe art done this way - this weird time-based way can be easier. Weight will be the key.

So, it just makes a bit more sense that their belief in themselves was metaphysical and time-dependent meta-physical as they so claim. It fueled their life progress legitimately or at least it fueled it in a healthy way that was artistically relevant to the fantasy world of time travel they popularized. And our knowledge of time is so flimsy even in this century that no one is really justified to say they were wrong to believe so. And who is to say that art does not, like religions tap into the fountain of time better.

All the stodgy sci-fi writers did not get it as they mixed all their literary power with literal science like themes and less evocative science-like sci-fi writing. Less evocative and possibly less true then doubly for influence and posited fact. And this particular person's advice in metaphor in TV comedy and later to themselves more clearly in written works was their own best guide. And they ""meant"" to show it was too. And they did. Reality meets art in a grander way in non-sci-fi reality-non-reality TV.

Yet, per the demands of the question, as far as sci-fi theories go this non-theory, or time traveler in the mist of art via self-aggrandizement, sure is one of the weirdest and thus best! I did not myself set out to write so much. Just created an account today and here we go.

In her autobiography Amy Poehler declares herself a firm or possibly very jocular believer in time travel. It could be this stance ironically arose after her stint on 'Parks and Recreations'.  [Leslie Knope](http://parksandrecreation.wikia.com/wiki/Leslie_Knope) is the character she played in that single-cam comedy. From time travelers point in some believed reality even a starring role would be a blink - metaphorical stint to us - in a life's eye upon itself. More likely she was influenced by other comedians. Or her upbringing but saying in this case is doing. So the more she wrote and advanced her career the more she believed in her own work and her art and came to believe more. I just believe in turn that P&amp;A stands out objectively as a great work on time travel and if her beliefs are to be interpreted at all literally OF time travel. And hope to support that below.

The language usage in this comment is going to be a bit rough to allow me to write, but those who read to the end should be able to forgive me if they follow my reasoning and the need for it's own special methods. Realistically, for sake of argument, season seven in this very popular series does lay on the future view pretty heavy. And the creators admit this was not all for comic story telling. I'm not saying it was for cosmic story telling. I'm just saying it's very convenient to make the interpretation. Also the interpretations was clearly intended so none needs to be frightened of uncomfortable conclusions. Some kind of fourth wall is intentionally if very subtly, maybe just to the show's creators as an inside joke, being knocked down. Kind of like the way Knope [shoves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGeG98rbyBI) Lindsay Carlisle Shay (Parker Posey), Eagleton's (nemesis) parks and recreation director into bags of garage in a previous season. Full disclosure: last season I watched.

&gt;After last [next to very last] 
&gt;season's finale flashed 
&gt;forward three years to 2017, 
&gt;we learned that the show was 
&gt;going to stick to that time jump, 
&gt;and the show's creator 
&gt;&gt;Mike Schur was 
&gt;&gt;quoted as saying 
&gt;&gt;that Parks would become 
&gt;&gt;""very gently sci-fi"" 
&gt;in its final season. 

From www.theverge.com

The fourth wall may have as regards Eagleton been that there are people out there who sympathies Mrs. Shay by looking down on Poehler politics. In her bio there is very much a rival town from her youth and she probably plays with an audience she imagines from those kinds of towns for her heated humour. But the fourth wall for the show itself in later seasons is for people that look up to the notions of what the future might be as cast from the mind of a comic savant. So this allows us to deconstruct the final episode and final fictional words of Poehler's and crew's character's and creation. But stepping lightly on egg shells full well knowing Poehler believes in teh meta sense of believing one can changer the future and share the positive out-look needed to do this. Negativism is the tendency to corrupt positivism with too much figuring things out and if this means not bothering to figure out physics that's fine too. She talks of course of having been poor in physics in ""Yes Please."" She talks of most everything to be hones. But teh most telling of tell is where she writes ""Don't think. Just do."" with no apologies to Nike either or wisecracks at all. It's difficult perhaps to understand the time-sense of those so much involved with life.

There is a very good argument that the last lines of P&amp;R were a testament to being in the moment. The words are the most in the moment words. But you can't buy that reading after her book. She is in the moment but it's mixed up with some otherwordly mysticism about moments being connected by this very unthinking way. Then it's not hard to imagine the final show being about that more complex moment. In the show Knope's distant future Governesses husband Ben asks, in closer times (in 2017 no doubt) in a small flash forward as the last scene to the last moment of the show, if she is ready. Her reply ""I am"" does more than foreshadow the previously time-disordered scenes from the 2020's timeline show scenes. It's her actual character sensing the portentous question's answer.

She's ready to rule, which really would be how Poehler would be expected to think about her princess, sending her off into the big world outside of little Pawnee, to become queen. Attempting a bit of deconstructive internal language there.

We are ready, could not have been answered as this would have been a straight give away to the wall. Perhaps with a wink from Poehler/Knope. Certainly full Poehler, neither fictionalized nor future scoped, is no true believer enough to think 'SHE' herself will be governor. But also I think Ben and Knope even if they were ""true believers"" would have disguised the question perhaps no more than as the cliche it is here. OR would have disguised it today for the sake of tomorrow so even they would not jinx themselves. 

But we must add that Poehler hides her cleverness behind down-home goodness all too easily. She is far more raunchy off camera then you might imagine in either the show or her book if that is an example of being able to be the real show-person either way.

""Are you ready?"", is not too far from a sports introduction such that bending our minds a bit now is this. ""On your mark?"" Knope may have been asked by Ben literally about a ""race"" in the final analysis with high enough levels of meta-deconstruction. In that way the show was not ending but beginning. Or was really ending if in some trippy state one is willing to view all time backwards. The analysis does not need to go that far. It needs to look at what writers think they could do when making impressions about time. 

IN childhood everyone recalls the familiar ""(are you) READY, GET SET, GO."" Fully modified as question this is ""ARE YOU READY? ARE YOU got SET? ok GO!"" Nothing-is-ever-lost on Poehler it seems is her comic genius. So similar connections like this would have been second nature. For my part I like the symmetry of decreasing finality of wordings from more letters to fewer. There was even some joke in my day: GET READY, GET SET, GET GO. 

This implies that one could answer ""NOT READY"" by visually breaking one's stance to interrupt. Such a quick count makes the need to do so. It appears a childish joke may have been on me and I may have always heard wrong in my local because I notice the regional differences. Link below. There are many ways to look at the start of a race in this context that would have been available to Mrs. Poehler.

[Etymology](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/33754/difference-between-on-your-mark-get-set-go-and-ready-steady-go)

Familiar very modern modifications include the very poignant ""ArE YoU ReAdY To RuMbLe??"" as well as ""Ready or not here I come?"" for more serious competitions which are not sports like. They are literally hiding games but also races to find people. The point is that asking these kinds of questions is never literal but in context. The best deconstruction of the words is facing the future like a race to get there. And writers continually think about how readers will deconstruct on an emotional level. So making this kind of final statement about future reality was a clear nod to beliefs in time's maleability. 

Why would the group who made the show not suggest that Ben and Leslie had actually lived there lives somewhat knowingly. It was there for the taking to do so and really these creative genius would not have wasted the whole season to fill in the the stories that ten more seasons could never do. It would be arrogant to try only that. I would have been a misuse of former writing skills to have committed to such a sketch. It had to be planned that they wanted this future view to work with it as if though it was relavant to the current time of the current season in a deep and meaningful way perhaps just shy of taking the entire show having the purpose to show how lives are connected. 

But only once it was really popular was their opportunity to take these wild risks. Or once the last season was know to be teh last.

But the belief in the belief about malleability can be much more fishy. Poehler could have dreamed up this show to make a clever dis-spoofing statement of everyone's sense of time. It's very much part of her world view sub-consciously. She likes to think about time in her own quirky way and she likes to share thoughts therefore its naturally to share a quirky time sense in commedy. But I think even she would be surprised to think of those moments of writing influencing her future so concretely as is going to be argued more and more below, without meta-ironic analogy of my own thoughts doing the same on a much smaller scale.

It's back to that principle of leaving out the start where things are created and end where how they were created has been processed. Try to imagine that some span of time doesn't doesn't exist if you will and that is the essence of time travel. People who face the future is what Poehler concludes her book with beside language that looks identical to ""people who face the future."" My dual explanations above is kind of a meta-explanation of how such people work. But hers art may be an even better meta-meta explanation of how people who think too much and seem to know so much are none the less still susceptible to being caught in those problematic times. They almost make them non-traversable by their very worry. If you have ever seen an interview Poehler you'll get how she is teh embodiment of don't worry be happy. I'm not. But to everyone else there is literally lots of rubbish either way critically deconstructing or faithfully constructing/un-deconstructing that has nothing to do with time and everything to do with self.

Lots of allegories are heaped on in her best selling book, that would make fans of shows like ""Continuum"" cringe. Perhaps some do here too but if you are going to talk about something important its important to talk about it for all people from all angle in all contexts. Again very much sounding like Poehler's politics which I have read. And if you believe in something powerfully it's only natural that as a comedian, writer, person it influence one's work in more than a figurative way.

Besides to get back to the show, her plot line about about April and Dan's alter ego's living in Washington can't help be a bit creepy today. Think Hellboy and Liz Sherman as controlled alters are transported to ""Pleasantville"" to have another Hellboy child. Especially since Amy Poehler's real-life mentor Tina Fey, was more fond of predicting a very different future in episodes (you can find) of more infamous now-cult status ""30 Rock"". Also this is comedy not sci-fi and NBC had to draw the line regardless. What if there were a spin-off?! Can't put those writers in the box unless they want to be there.

But who are future selves is the real question, and what is fiction, pre-non-fiction, if we are already them, anyway. Given this pretense, pardon the pun we can muse up this fantasy deconstruction into a bizarre incidence of some theory, who knows the real answer to. (Leslie I mean Mrs. Poehler does provide basis in her book, ""Yes Please"".) After the relevant facts and in the correct timeline, was either her character's opinions about the ""real future"" or her own? 

Meaning to be clear was Poehler's use of comic time travel sub-genre creatively a true self fulfilling prophecy of formation in beliefs. At this juncture when or where she adopted her stance is impossible to tell because the self-fulfilling notion's definition would determine the cause. Definitions occur in time so no amount of hypothesis is paradoxically inadmissible with current non-time-traveling science as far as we know. Perhaps when she says in ""Yes Please"" her grandfather ""made magic"" as point in one of her ending chapters on time travelers - Patti Smith essence appears also to occupy Seth Meyer's earlier time host-body in one section - she was attempting to verbalize the start of the belief system. I like to think she made her own magic on the way and that no one ever can tell when beliefs began. But it can't have been easy.

Which may have been directed at ideas that had not have formed yet! Stephen King says, ""the hardest things to write are the most difficult."" Leslie wrote some hard words she thinks and says so to annoying distraction* in the first chapter, in her auto-bio too, but she may have just set herself up. The hardest words were just those two words for her time-traveling imaginary self IOHO that she was ready. Then later she was brave enough to come out of the box. Now that is punk-ass time travel.

Please correct me if she has been proselytizing publicly her whole life because her belief about time was news when I bought the book. She made me uneasy by being forth right. But as they say talk but they say it because its done cheap in relation to thoughts that have no affect outside one's own mind. When one broadens the field talk becomes priceless when it talks right. Even hypothetically if she were to say she had visions of time travel ideas since childhood and further more her Dad WAS a TimeLord or it could be he outed her. Those would in this alternate universe if it ever happened be even more easy words she never considered and so were just something she would be about to have toughly believed and had did not truly then.

One thing we know is that the show was about progress and disestablishmentarianism which I contend are synonymous to a life spent believing in the best future as Leslie Knope was clearly portrayed as. Hiding time-travel ideas in a comedy looks brilliant but it could be that hiding time travel ideas any where takes brilliance. You have to hide them better than you know based upon your future selves politics towards time travel. That is if future self has figured out some Jedi mind trick that had then would be about working on past self. 

So making the full show because of her hidden belief system message would-could by this logic of time be heroic. Only an absolutely perky optimist like Knope, named possibly with irony, could embody such a conundrum of moving things continually into the future along a metaphor of a career for maintaining parks. We all know Lucas had long range dreams about his art grounded in the mysticism of Joseph Campbell. But how much easier to make a simple fable of a women tending trees (in parks inevitably in small towns) which are myths for the ways in which our minds are all interconnected. Without need for complicating and possibly impeding logic. In the oddest of recursion she and her co-creators and/or creator bosses, had to distance themselves from reality correctly or incorrectly enough to be able to guide the show to it's conclusion in this artistically genuine and truly fabled way. 

Apologies to the other creators and people who guided the show and not knowing the exact degree of their contributions toward making the regular show about future characters of that show in it's final season very much a reality. It's funny if nothing because it is the anti-quantum leap where the characters actually do leap into the future and maybe they aren't aware really. So the super-hero political couple of The Knopes interpretation isn't really exactly to the point either. It's quite possibly a show about people jumping through time like Kilgore Trout which really would be having fun with the audience. But the notions of the life managed as some super planner in the sky cannot be shaken by now. Your more in on it the less you are. 

What I like to do when thinking about these things as I myself obviously have is to find other shows with a lineage to the shows in question. Similar producers, directors, actors and such. Can we see in the history between shows developing or expanding attitudes toward time-travel that is in a deconstructionist way. Because if there is a Schrodinger's cat hiding in show business then the only way to ever find it has been inside the art itself. 

Seth Meyer is clearly the mutual best friend of Amy Poehler and his very own HULU original was at heart about a super-hero who can stop time for a minute. I rest my case if some has critiqued that show. So maybe I have overstepped bounds in typifying a private journey for Poehler and making her sound a bit convoluted in her opinions. She's like the cheerleader for time travel theory. So I think that makes her show the most messed up time-travel advice book there is. Unless time-travel techs are football players in disguise. 

Then through an ultras science of non-interference which is what Toaism says about time, this show IS the most sense even if it MAKES the least to claim so. Without Taoist insight. Zen the child of Tao and Buddhism says things like ""what was the face of your mother before you were born."" It's lack of ""non-sense"" seemingly making outside the sci-fi genre of sense for these things cheers us on. Never gets in the way of its players.

Or making myself seem that same as I have no shows to my credit and only a fantastic appreciation of Tina Fey's body of work to blame for my eventually noticing Poehler's. That and reading ""Dune"" when I was fifteen or so. And being badly disappointed at how badly that fared as artistic cross-over. I guess time-conjecturally Herbet knew his shit well enough to keep it out of others.

So to wrap up as a life longer dreamer of being a writer I am very harsh on those who say what they wrote was tough. It's usually the circumstances making the work tough not some innate difficulty, if one even had a shot in the first place at the career. It's nice to just sit down and not be disturbed by others what if I cannot write. 

Though when one, restating the thesis of humble bureaucrats and pencil pushers of all sorts here, expands the notion of ""difficult writing"" to managing physical time writing in the future and the present, where our writer selves are connect, in the way hypothetical Guild Members onboard Guild ships in guild tanks can to do by moving mentally through time with the aid of spice, then it's amazing that humans can still type. 

Such is a theme from ""Continuum"" where Jason Sadler says that so many choices about the future  *IF* one sees the future, (depending on the nature of the insight) make life debilitating. Or it could be simple temporal karma. Easy artistic creation at one moment in time followed by difficult at another, when really the both times produced the same work for those who could see. I had years of writing where no one saw the work and honesty that was far more enjoyable. Not making this about myself.

The complicated thing is when one deconstructs one's own life's work and in particular concrete works of art that seem to stare one in the face. It's difficult to not lay blame like any other with a Western Mind set. Why didn't I know so to speak. Why was it such trash AND difficult. That may be why the West loves it critics. Why the west invented deconstruction! And would do well to leave it.

It may be that one was lucky enough to have the fun writing first and pay for teh difficult writing later when you can afford too. One might have been less fortunate to have not benefited from the fun times writing so the hard work seems pointless. A mere post on reddit, but that is just fate. There's still a way to let go of the deconstruction and make life reconstructive. Who really knows who will be affected by one's journey. Sometimes just yourself.

I will say for myself now that Poehlers show looks more like fresh air then it did (though actually living there I'd be in the part of town that doesn't get to visit parks often.) It seemed in the genre of comedy lampooning everything but sometimes that's nice way to get through to those in towns ostensibly less fortunate who notice nothing of the sort. Ultimately it's which town you live in to decide which is better. The town where willy creatures span that ubiquitous word time with their own definitions for it's physics, or the town where time is harnessed more willfully to avoid ""a dirty little nightmare from which you will never wake up"".

[DISCUSS] Is Parks and Rec Better than the office?,"Crosspost from /r/DunderMifflin

I just don't find parks and rec to be very funny at all. The characters and antics are too over the top. I like The Office for it's subtlty, restraint, and believability. Also Michael Scott was just more laugh out loud funny for me than Leslie Knope. Both shows are good but I see the comparison made A LOT and think the Office is on another level.

Then, she left for Rwanda because she had to do Doctors Without Borders. Nadia said she'd call Tom when she got back, but guess what? SHE NEVER CALLED! Why? She and Tom were great together! I get really upset whenever I get to this part of the show because it feels like a huge hole was left there and no one covered it up. If anyone has an explanation as to why Nadia never returned to the show, please comment. ",PandR,1494040373,shaboogey,6,11,True,2017-05-05

Ron reveals that after Leslie took April, Andy and Terry to work with her, and Tom and Donna left to run their businesses, he got lonely for his old friends and one day, he suddenly didn't recognize anyone in the department. He decided to ask Leslie for a job in the National Park Service during lunch the following day, but when she stood him up for lunch due to her hectic schedule, he just quit. The two finally reconcile through the power of alcohol, and the rest of the former department find a very confusing scene the next morning. Ron later meets Leslie for lunch and gives her a picture frame made of Ann's front door.|

One scene I keep thinking back to is when Ron is talking to Leslie about her then-bf Justin. Ron says, ""He‚Äôs a tourist. He vacations in people‚Äôs lives, takes pictures, puts them in his scrapbook and moves on. All he‚Äôs interested in are stories.

I really wish I had invested in the show years ago when it was airing so I could've have the seven years of airing and growing alongside the characters. Can't wait for a rewatch. ",PandR,1494549551,Nickerdoodle,11,13,True,2017-05-11

Ron in past seasons prided himself on being set in his ways, occasionally leading to points of immaturity, as seen in the episode with Mark inspecting his wood shop and the parks department barbeque.

Being in a relationship with Diane has made him realize that change can be okay, and that making the occasional personal sacrifice (having loud kids play in your office, eating bananas, and taking touristy pictures of london) is necessary.

### Series Finale ""One Last Ride""
|||
|:--  |:-- |
|**Synopsis**|In the last day in Pawnee, Leslie rallies the entire team for one last Parks Project: fixing a swing in a park. A series of flash-forwards show bits of what will happen to the characters over the next years and decades. Typhoon and Craig get married, Andy and April become parents, Donna sets up a non-profit with her husband, Tom becomes a best-selling author, Garry serves as Mayor until his death at age 100, and Ron finds happiness in a job as a park superintendent for the National Park Service. Ben is elected to Congress, and he and Leslie are separately courted to run for governor of Indiana. After considering who should run, Ben decides that Leslie would be a better candidate. The two then visit the Parks department and see all of their friends once more. Ann and Chris reappear and decide to move back to Pawnee. In the future Leslie serves two terms as governor, and hints at a ""new, unknown challenge"" in a speech; at Garry's funeral (depicted earlier in the episode, but occurring further in the future), she and Ben are accompanied by what appears to be a Secret Service detail, in a scene left intentionally ambiguous.|

"I am sorry, but, ann kinda bothers me So far(Just started season 3)","Sorry about the title, I don't know why it formatted strangely.  I guess this has spoilers if you have not watched as far as the beginning of Season 3.

Also, please no spoilers for me, friends.

Hi everyone.  I want to like Ann and I do like her when she is being Leslie's friend.  That is when she is at her best, so far.  But I have a pet peeve about people who act really nice and caring to everyone, but then are actually selfish and no one notices it.  For example, she looked down on Andy the whole time (which I get, I mean he was childish and a slob and all that) but did not appreciate his good traits.  And when he tries to win her back, she gets all condescending and acts like he is subhuman.  Andy is a mess, but an adorable mess who has an amazing heart.

I think as a caretaker personality, Ann does get something out of sort of feeling better than people who are sick and stuff.  That sounds terrible.  It may just be because I know caretaker type people like that IRL who are only able to be a good friend to you when you are not well or your life is a mess.  But, when you are better, they can't stand to be around you, and sort of want you to stay a mess forever so they can be the sane and functional hero, saving their train wreck mess of a friend. It can hurt.  

Anyway, that isn't the main point, but what really grinds my gears is how as soon as she sees that April and ~~Chris~~ Andy might actually be happy together, even though she actually has a man herself and has options, she can't stand that.  She can't just let the two of them be happy, she feels completely entitled to mess that up because her ego can't stand that she lost a guy and that gasp, another woman, might get him.  

It just strikes me as incredibly ruthless and selfish, and nobody is going to call her out on it because she comes off as a caretaker.  But she uses the caretaking to make herself look good and always has this kind of ""I am so patient and saintly"" attitude.

Regarding her character.  Basically, her actual character I cannot define.  I know her roles--nurse, Leslie's friend, and the Straight Man.  Otherwise in terms of her actual personality coming out, the main thing I can think of is that incident above, of selfishness.

I don't think she is the best straight man.  April and Ben are both good...April is completely a unique character of her own, with her quirks, but she also has that teenage ""I can't believe this BS"" attitude without being a total jerk, because you can tell that she is soft at heart and really cares, but just doesn't like to show it.  Ann is the opposite, she comes off as the most caring giving person, but when it comes down to it, she gets angry that another woman might make her ex happy.

Ben is great so far of the little I have seen, because he is the total serious guy but he does not have to break character to be the straight man.  Ann basically to me is just Jim &amp; Pam from the Office mixed together.  They think they are better than everyone because they are ""normal"" and not ""weird"" like everyone else, which is a really high school attitude.  Having the straight character is completely possible without them being condescending and superior to everyone.

Anyway, I am not saying the show shouldn't have had her, or anything, necessarily, but I just feel like she breaks the flow.  And, I feel that I was expected to really like her, and that bothers me, because I don't actually think she is likable.  I just know a lot of real people who like to act really caring, and can be giving, but when it comes down to it they like to feel superior, and are kind of out for themselves.  Why didn't she look in the mirror and realize that trying to ruin things between Andy and April is a jerk move?  Just because she thinks she ""created"" Andy by taking care of him, somehow.  In fact, she kept him dependent, and only when he hit rock bottom did he turn his life around.

Even her and Leslie, she is a true friend to her, but she likes to get that attitude about her too.  ""Wow, look how messy my crazy friend's apartment is,"" and all that.  

I feel a lot of people love her so I am not sure how anyone will react her, but I just want to say this.   Thank you.

Edit: I will say that if I see her character develop later, and I see people call her out on her flaws, and I see her realize her imperfections, I will be much more satisfied with her presence.   I do fear however, that this may not happen.   

I actually find it very unnatural that nobody ever clashes with her in the show so far.  Andy and Mark only clash in the sense of wanting her back.  It's not any kind of fight or argument  per se.  Now, you can definitely argue that her attractiveness explains why they act that way.  Still, most of the characters are involved enough that occasional personality clashes happen.  Even Trish and that attractive journalist lady get in disagreements with people. 

Since Ann isn't a Parks employee, she is very separate.  Never actually down to earth and real enough to have a personality conflict.  It's jarring to me.  ",PandR,1495150047,Rivkariver,23,8,True,2017-05-18

Do you Agree with Ann About Relationships?,"One of the more serious moments in the show is when Ann is talking with Mark about their relationship, and she's saying they need to break up, and Mark claims that they ""never fight"" and he doesn't understand why Ann feels they need to break up. 

Ann replies by saying that it's not good that they never fight, that couples are supposed to fight. 

Alright, so basically, I've been dating this girl for almost four months now, it's my first ""real"" relationship, I guess you could say, and we were watching Parks together when this episode came on, and I just felt kinda awkward about it. I really like her, and we haven't fought at all, and now I'm wondering if it could be a bad sign for our relationship?

"I think this show has one of, if not the best plot devices of any comedy show in season 7. [Spoilers ahead]","So my favourite comedy (don't shoot me if you dislike it) is How I Met Your Mother. HIMYM's best element to me was the fact that Ted is telling his kids this long-winded story like parents love to do. PandR took a very interesting turn with fast forwarding 10 years. This is the only other plot device from a comedy that I actually think rivals HIMYM's main plot device. 

When Anne and Chris left, I was bummed out because I loved both of the characters. I immediately google why they left, and the interview I was looking at seemed to make a hell of a lot of sense from a producer's aspect. They were moving onto one of their final chapters in life, starting a family. Pawnee was the place that they met, and that would always be magical to them, but it wasn't the place they needed to be in to settle down.

Leslie and Ben having kids is where I was thinking about the show is ending just as everyone is really starting to have their lives to come together - so I really did not want to see the show ending as the lives are forming. This is why I feel I maybe biased, but aren't we all? 

Skipping forward in time allowed for many different things to take place; Ron and Leslie's beef was just hilarious to say the least, ending with the hysterical can episode where they don't leave the office...I really wanted Leslie to try and break the glass just for Ron to say he had unbreakable glass installed, but that's off-topic...the predictions is definitely one of the best things about season 7!

Just like how Back to the Future had us for years and years saying ""I wonder if that will actually come to light."" PandR had us doing the same, and we were all doing it this year. We just had to contrast the show from reality, to show how far off (or better yet, close to) the 'predictions' were. I know they weren't really predictions, but still!

Then we got that kick-ass finale that imo is actually the best thing about comedies ending...they always have amazing finales! Don't bring up HIMYM's to me, because I'm actually an advocate for believing the finale was amazing, so there's potential to feelings being hurt on both sides. If you want to discuss that at all, feel free to PM me because I always love discussing TV --shit, I really did go off-topic there, sorry-- we got it with HIMYM, Community, Psych...we got those wholesome episodes at the end where even though it was ending, we cried happy tears for our characters. 

It's very hard to use flashbacks, or flashforwards as a main plot device. The only time I can recall a show using flashbacks as a main plot device, and doing it well, is Person of Interest. It used drips and drabs as a mystery invoker and to increase hype surrounding certain characters like Grace and Harold. You could've just had an episode with Reese and Finch thinking they're about to die in this room, and have them spill the beans about their pasts. 

The fact that PoI is one of the only rivals to the level of flashbacks on PandR, in relation to PoI being one of the better dramas in the past decade, and PandR being known for its satire and goofy comedy speaks volumes. When it's revealed that Ron was stood up by Leslie, I think most of us wanted to give Ron a hug more than laugh at him.

The relationship between Andy and April was so beautiful, and Leslie's evolution from mild mannered parks department employee to Governor of Indiana was so amazing.

This may be a seemingly light-hearted comedy on the surface, but I feel this show has a lot of depth to it.

[Request] less known Leslie quotes,"Hey there! I recently spent an open week essentially rewatching all of Parks and Rec, and I realize the huge impact its had on me. I watched my initial run of the show while I was taking a government course, and it really opened my eyes to the smaller levels of government and before I knew it, I was accepting an internship with my local city council. (I even served as mayor in a mock city-council meeting!) Well long story short, that internship snowballed into a ton of service projects &amp; I've since been handed another internship with my Community Coalition, and I'm absolutely loving every minute of it. The work I'm doing there combined with my rewatching had completely solidified my goals to go to school for a degree like PoliSci or Poltics, Philosophy, and Economics, or Public Policy so I can make a career out of municipal government. It's the time of year where I need to start deciding on a senior quote, and I think a Leslie Knope quote will convey the message I want to share about my career choice. The problem I find is that none of the quotes I see online really have those gritty truthful Leslie moments- the most shared ones are about waffles or Ann being a beautiful sunfish.

Also, Chris Pratt was originally listed as a guest star for parts of season one, so were they going to give him more of a Roy from The Office role (something we see flashes of in season one)? If so, why? If he was supposed to be not right for Ann, who was? It's pretty clear throughout the first two seasons (season one especially) that they were leaning into a Leslie/Mark pairing someways down the road, so was Ann supposed to be the best friend that gets in between them?

As someone who watched all of the show at once, I'm curious as to whether any of the writers have come out and explained what the original plan for the characters were. I know why they wrote Mark out, I'm just wondering what they had planned before they did it.

Possibly why Andy Dwyer is the way he is...,"One thing that puzzled me about Andy's characterization in the show is that he seems to be really, really childish and really stupid. Almost like a kid who's never had an adult in his whole life to look up to, and therefore grew up to be a manchild who doesn't know how to adult at all, tries to use Ann to literally babysit him under the guise of a relationship, manages to get a girl who's almost as childish as he is, looks up to Ron as a father figure, and so much more.

Well, in season 5 episode 13, when he sits for his police exam, he responds to the question of what he'd do if he pulled over his father for speeding, and the first thing he responds is shock at realizing his father is alive, and then strays off on some other tangent. I think, it's probably having to live with an absent father and not being surrounded by sensible adults that makes him the playful, clueless, scrappy guy he is. This did explain a lot, and I did also kinda feel sad for the character, making me want to root even more for stupid, gullible, loving Andy Dwyer, who indeed does say the cutest things.

If that is true, then it's even more sensible and strong writing on the part of the creators. Man, this show...",PandR,1481315747,ChrisTheJason,5,17,True,2016-12-09

Noticed something strangely familiar in the skyline of pawnee,"So this [shot](http://i.imgur.com/snr6adk.png) is from S6E13 and I suppose not many can find anything wrong with it. I live in Tallinn, Estonia and Pawnee's skyline was weirdly similar to Tallinn's, especially because of a single tower.

Thank you for your attention.

A Problem with April and andy's relationship.,"I'll start by saying that April was my favourite character in the show as she was the person that developed the most, from being a young socially awkward girl into a strong minded career driven woman. The problem is she got married to a character who made basically no progression from beginning to end, so whilst April and Andy made sense at the start when they were on the same emotional level, as April grew up her pairing with Andy just got weirder and weirder. By the final season April was on par with Leslie as an intelligent grown woman and yet she was with a man who was mentally a child and so watching them together was less funny and more uncomfortable. I suppose the marriage stopped the show writers from splitting them up and I'm glad they pressed on with developing April's character regardless but I can't help feel they should have done something with Andy to make the relationship more natural.

Ann perkins sucks,"I'm currently on my like 4th watch through of Parks And Rec. It's one of my all-time favorite show and I'm really seeing more stuff this watch-through. One impression I've been noticing a lot this watch-through is that Ann Perkins is perhaps the most one-dimensional main character in the show. She is not terribly funny, has little depth, and does not show compassion easily. Her lines are the most scripted and she is usually the center of  the more shallow plot points. She is also a poor best friend for Leslie. She does not have much commitment to public service, has no obvious intellectual interests (beyond nursing, Leslie, and romantic relationships), and never matches Leslie's friendship intensity. Maybe it has to do with Rashida Jones' comedic/acting ability, a writing staff oversight, or overshadowing by more dynamic character.

Characters' personalities and how I relate to them,"""As you know if you read the book, I've outlined 7 different types of successful people.""


Part of what made Parks and Rec my (still) favorite comedy is that I can relate to all the main characters' personality, despite how different they are from each other. The cast plays them wonderfully but it's amazing to see how well written they are. Let's take the Tom Haverford Personality Test for a moment.

**Leslie** is my competitive side, with big ambitions, lots of resilience, a taste for waffles and the little voice in my head that tells me ""keep trying"". I really loved how her personality evolved on the show.

**Ben**, well if I'm being honest I'm a total Ben. Geeky, blunt, sensitive and sometimes too serious, always wanting to try new things. I also relate
I had loved calzones since I know what a pizza is, and I thank Ben for having this same rare taste ;)

**Tom** is the would-be entrepreneur in me, always having ideas and wanting to take risks. He also shares my love for material things and showmanship. Not one of my favorites as he's sometimes too much of a caricature, but I often find myself in him.

**Chris** brings out my exuberant side and the fact that I'll always show an ""always happy"" face even I'm at my lowest. The excessive perfectionist he is sometime also ressembles me of my finest hours ^^

**Andy** is obviously the goofball in me, when I unrealisticly wish I was still a child to avoid life's problem or boringness and just play Legos and eat candy all day. But without silver spray paint, please.

The hard case : **Ron**. He is so iconic I have to be humble about him. He is my ""grumpy"" moments, me saying ""this **** is stupid and I don't want any part of it"" and sticking to my beliefs. But I'm too much of a people pleaser to even dare to be any more like him. As a DIY enthousiast I wish I was half the craftman he is.
Irrelevant here, but him being responsible for most of my uncontrolable laugh makes him de facto my favourite character.

**Ann** is as impulsive as me and I like that she is always there for her friends (until season 6, why did you leave Ann :S). I can't relate to her much cause her personnality lacks development IMHO but I like her for her interactions with the others ant the way she cares, guide and motivates them most of the time.

**April** shows my rebel, ""I don't give a shit"" side. Probably the character I ressemble the least, as I'm far from a cold, cynical man, but I like the weird chemistry she has with some characters like Chris or Ron, and she and Andy makes a wonderful, always funny couple.

I don't really identify that much to **Donna** either, but she symbolize my epicurian moments when I just search to enjoy things. I couldn't say that is my main trait thought.

**Jerry**, finally (what do you definitely not want to be?) is my clumsy moments, when I walk into a room without paying attention and break something, or drop a . My ""Oh jeeze"" moments that happens more often than I would.

I mean, these are just how I see how I relate to the show's characters, but I think most of the viewers loved the show 'cause they could relate to some aspects of every main character. I love these people so much I wish Pawnee was real so I could move here &lt;3

What's a synonym for protect? Guard. Andy is vowing to be a GUARDIAN OF April, because when he has her he feels like the luckiest man in THE GALAXY. Crazy foreshadowing, right? 

Even crazier is that Andy and April's Fancy Party first aired on August 14^th, 2011, and Chris Pratt was cast as Star Lord in Guardians of the Galaxy a year and a half later, in February 2013. I'm not saying these events have anything to do with each other, I'm just saying it's kind of cool.

Later on in the season she talks about running for Dexhart's district, but needing to live there first (for 51% of the time). If she got voted out of office, are we to assume (given she was replaced by an Eagleton representative) that the district she vacated went unrepresented?

Can we talk about Ben and Leslie's break up?,"In the premiere of Season 4, Ben reveals to Leslie that he knows about her city council campaign, by presenting her with a ""KNOPE 2012"" badge. 

This has to be one of the most gut wrenching break up scenes that I've ever seen on television. The lack of music (due to it being a mockumentary) just makes everything feel so real. The emotion in each of the characters as they experience what has to be one of the most bittersweet moments of their lives just hits so hard. 

The audience can easily feel the support and love that Ben has for Leslie, something that I didn't think would be able to be captured for this character. When Leslie first started seeing Ben as a potential love interest, I was extremely skeptical. I kept thinking to myself that the thing that made Leslie's character work was that she was independent and the story focused more on her career than her love life. But the writers pulled it off. They brought in a character who truly understood this other character and deserved her. 

In most television shows, break ups usually suck to watch, but aren't too terrible because you automatically know they'll get back together; it's the classic Ross &amp; Rachel scenario. This felt different though. Watching these two break up had a sense of permanence to it. It was a true mark of sacrifice and emotion. 

Like I said, Ben and Leslie felt like a bad cliche idea when I first experienced the show, but now I see their relationship as one of the best and most well-paced romances on television. This show knows its characters and they alone keep it going strong all seven seasons. ",PandR,1463533538,Swankified_Tristan,2,16,True,2016-05-17

About Parks and Rec and the job search,"An Open Statement about Parks and Recreation:

If you ever find yourself in the situation that I am now, currently seeking new employment in your mid-20s, and you need to have something going on in the background to keep the countless resumes and cover letters from driving you mad, pop on Parks and Rec. 
When you are looking for your dream job and coming up with nothing but place holders and compromises, it‚Äôs so inspiring to look at almost any character on the show. Take Ron, working since pre-adolescence he has found a career that lets him pursue his side-hustles of wood working and investing while still getting to milk the government for wages for doing basically nothing. Look at Leslie, who chose to be so committed to something that she eventually cared too much and had to keep moving higher and higher. Look at April who was killing time until she decided to make up her own position, take charge of a department and still remind Andy that no one really knows what they‚Äôre doing. Ben bounces around from job so quick that accepting a job is basically second nature to him. Even Andy, loveable goofball Andy, is able to accidentally become great at something and have fun at work doing something creative that he loves. Donna keeps her office job in a small town so that she can pay off her condo in Seattle and live the luxury life she wants to. And last but not least Tom, the small town mogul who will throw his last penny into his dreams, after years of struggle he makes it work.
 I know this is a television show, that it‚Äôs not always realistic or true, but when you‚Äôre staring dead eyed at another description of some 9-5 that may or may not be your dream you can always look to these fantastic characters to see how it can all be better if you let it. And hey! At least you‚Äôre not Jerry!
... Just kidding, Jerry had a very fulfilling life too.

"I must ask, but why is Parks ad Recration so heavily and annoyingly compared to the office?","I'm not a fan of the office, and it's sad because I thought ""oh I am so sick of everyone taking about this damn show"" so I set down to watch the U.S. version and I just do not get it. Now I am sure most people on the sub probably think Parks and Rec is better, and there could be some office fans in the mix. Anyways, back to the original point, both shows have very different humor style, with some awkward humor which works more because it plays off the cast but that is not the majority. All of the office consists of is yelling, or awkward reactions from and to one another.  However, where Pawnee is a town dealing with potentially real or hilariously exaggerated issues, with the focus on local government it just makes it funnier.",PandR,1463851933,[deleted],14,0,True,2016-05-21

Favorite moment from the first two seasons?,"Most would probably agree that seasons 1 and 2 had a relatively different feel to them than seasons 3-7. After all, two of the main (and very likable) characters hadn't arrived yet and the show was still finding itself and trying not to turn into another Office remake, which it ultimately succeeded at, again, in seasons 3-7.  

It took me a while to get into this show. Hell, I almost didn't make it through Season 1, which only has six episodes. However, going back and re-watching, I've discovered that the early episodes actually have some pretty great moments. 

Personal Example: 

Anne: (Looking at a picture of Dave [Louis C.K.] Aww, that's a great photo. 

Leslie: Thanks. I asked the police if I could have it and they said 'no' so I stole it.

Dear Parks and Recreation,"Dear Parks and Recreation seven seasons one hundred and twenty five episodes later its been about two weeks since I started this journey and now 15 minutes after finishing the finale I sit here in tears and many other emotions. In these short two weeks this show has thought me more about true friendship love life and service then I have learned my life so far. To many this was nothing more then a comedy TV show but to me it feels like so much more. You see when you consume a TV show like this one with so much emotion and true personality in such a short period of time you feel as if these characters are almost your friends and your watching a chapter in ones life. The truly amazing characters from my personal favorites of Ron Swanson and Ben Wyatt to the amazingly talented April Ludgate. These people even if only fictional characters where something more after these short two weeks the feel as if they were life long friends and as the series now ends it feels as if I've opened a new chapter in my life and much like Ron Swanson and Leslie Knope I sit her wanting to be with these friends all in one room and feel sorrow and sadness at the thought of loosing these great ""work proximity acquaintance"". These people each teaching me something new which honestly are virtues I strive everyday to carry on in my real life now. Ron Swanson the silent yet caring man with strong manly virtues has brought me to come to his way which I use everyday and I have even started wood working. Leslie Knope has shown me the ways of civil service and has helped me realize what it truly is to help the people and community you believe in and love. This has brought me a new found respect for my tiny Midwestern town much like Pawnee Indiana [spoiler] (#s ""pre expansion of course.""). Benjamin Wyatt a subtle nerd much like me and a lover of accounting and finance. Also and driven public servant winning mayor ship of his town at 18. Ben has driven me to looking to running for public office in my local town now. Andy Dwyer has thought me so much about how sometimes its ok to let it loose and have fun and to be kind to everyone and sometimes you can role-play a crazy dream job much like the amazing Burt Macklin. It these small things that Andy has thought me that I strive to remember each and every day. April Ludgate a quite publicly world hating girl but truly on the inside loves helping the world improve she has thought me much in ways I simple cannot put into to words but I believe we all feel. Gary Gergich even though many people hated him much like Ben I felt Gary was one of the best people I have ever fictionally had the honor of meeting/watching and learning his values. He was clumsy but even when insulted by everyone else played dumb but truly knew what was going on this [spoiler] (#s ""was evident after he told Ben later on.""). This kind hearted amazing man has showed me more than anyone else what true service to others means to sit there and work night after night for years coming back out of retirement to help his friends for no thanks at all and even to be insulted. This amazing man with a family I can only dream of having some day was truly a Pawnee hero [spoiler] (#s ""and the future scene of garys death in 2043 even if a very happy one surrounded by family at age 100 was the saddest moment in parks and rec history for me and brought many many tears.""). Tom Haverford while at first eccentric and frankly stupid thought me so much about the true spirit of entrupruenlyship later on in the series I cannot even put to words how he has thought me and how it honestly improves my daily life. Donna Meagle thought me that its ok to ""Treat YO SELF"" this is something I needed to be thought after for many years not treating my self and I thank Donna for that needed pick me up. Now while this may have only been a TV series to some I can happily say I this felt like so much more to me and this show has made me a better person in so many ways and as I sit her tonight and cry and probably restart the series again for the now second time through!!

"Just finished the Series for the first time, here are my thoughts. [Mild Spoilers]","I'm going to compare this to The Office, because I have watched that over and over.  
I feel like the humor in P and R is much more forced than in The Office, and that can also be attributed to the characters. The Office has so many different types of people, including normal people, where in PR, everyone is weird in some sort of way. No one is there to balance out the crazies.  

The Finale just seemed off, actually, the whole last season. I just feel like going into the future and skipping three years wasn't the best choice in my opinion. The Finale was just where they had one episode to make everything good, but the entire show is about things going wrong. Also, the Gryzzl technology and all of the future stuff just seems off, I can't place it, but that kind of lessened the experience of the Finale.  

I like the show, but it seemed like I was just watching it to see how they end up. And again, this is all just my opinion.

Something that's bothered me about the show...,"They specifically address/acknowledge the camera and film crew on several instances throughout the series, but it wasn't an in depth thing. They used the format of a mockumentary without providing an in-universe context, and I just find that a little weird. 

I know it's not meant to be thought of to a serious extent, but it's just a little weird is all. It made sense that they'd use the same format as the Office in earlier seasons, but to not throw context on the format makes it feel like characters are breaking the fourth wall every time they look at the camera or have head shot scene.

Starring: Jean Ralphio and Mona Lisa Saperstein

With: Barney Varmn, Dennis Feinstein, Perd Hapley, Carl Lorthner, Kyle, Oren

The siblings have started a champagne flavoured gelato business and have hired Barney Varmn as their accountant. Dennis Feinstein is the villain, becoming the #1 Perfumist only made his appetite for power more ravenous, his sights are now set on World Domination. Kyle and Oren developed a perfume so good that it makes people fall in love. Dennis found out and locked them in the guesthouse of his mansion so he can steal their recipe and get credit for it. Oren and Kyle are so apathetic that they don't try to escape but Perd finds out using his psychic powers and tries to free them in order to report the case. He hires Carl Lorthner to investigate but his really loud voice consistently ruins everything. Here's a glimpse:

Carl: KYLE... OREN... ARE YOU IN THERE? HEY GUYS HOW'S IT GOIN'?

Kyle: Oh, hey Carl. Yeah, it's okay. It'd be nice if he gave us water though.

Oren:

Perd [through walkie talkie]: Carl, have you, as the old expression goes, ""cracked the case"" ?

Carl: JUST A MINUTE PERD I- OH. DENNIS FEINSTEIN'S MUTANT LAVENDER PLANT GUARDS FOUND ME SOMEHOW, TIED ME TO THE PERFUME SILO.

Perd: Well, it seems we'll have to wait until next time on ""Renaissance Love"".

Kyle: Hey, um, do you think you could get a doctor over here? One of Feinstein's Ocelots gnawed my leg off. It should be okay, just wondering...

I love the way P&amp;R introduces new things in the show earlier than usual,"Bit of a shitty title, but it's hard to summarize. Basically, Parks and Rec does something I haven't seen in other shows - rather than introduce a new character/relationship/idea/whatever at the start of an episode or the start of a season, it will introduce it towards the end of the previous episode or season. Not quite the same as foreshadowing, where something is hinted at, but more like introducing something and just leaving it unexplained until later.

Example #1: The character of Dennis Feinstein is mentioned in Season 2 Episode 16 (and again in Season 2 Episode 21). The character doesn't actually appear until Season 3 Episode 6.

Example #2: Ben and Chris first appear in Season 2 Episode 23, and then play a major role in Season 3 onwards. Traditionally, new characters would be introduced at the start of the season.

Example #3: Orin is first mentioned in Season 3 Episode 3, but doesn't appear until Season 3 Episode 9.

I really like the way the show does this. It makes it seem like the P&amp;R universe is consistent and real, as opposed to the traditional way of introducing new concepts at the start of an episode and having everything return to the status quo by the end of the episode.",PandR,1467083250,Chet_Awesomelad,6,36,True,2016-06-27

* Jerry Farts, better have the entire cast make fun of him for the rest of the scene, beat the joke the death. This is not just a 1 time thing, this is a running gag thats not funny and completely over done. It just feels like every 4 episodes has a Jerry fart joke moment. 

* Or another is, Jerry is talking. How about everyone is mean to him for no apparent reason and lets keep doing that for 7 seasons. 

* The one I did like was, his wife and everyone trying to figure out how that happened.

He forced Ben to resign so Leslie and Ben could still date but does nothing to punish Ann or Tom? I don't get it. Neither Tom or Ann even tries to hide it from him from fear of his rule. Chris ends up finding out about Tom and Ann but does not even mention the rule to them. The same can be said for April and Andy but I believe they were married when Chris arrived so I could understand him allowing that. This just drives me crazy how Chris almost ruined Leslie's campaign from the scandal about her workplace relationship with Ben but does not care about anyone else!,PandR,1467514498,jakebake102,5,7,True,2016-07-02
But...why the cameras?,"This question has been on my mind through every rewatch of the show. A major part of the show is when characters talk directly to the camera, giving the show sort of a mockumentary feel similar to what the office did. 

Except...the Office addressed that they were filming a documentary in the first episode and by the end the documentary was released and became a part of the plot. In Parks and Rec, at least from what I recall, at no point do they mention why they might all possibly be followed around by cameras all the time.

just finished seasons 1-7. quick Question...,"Without going through every episode's wiki/IMDB/etc, is anyone aware of a major writer's switch or show direction between seasons 5 and 6? 

The first 5 seasons were unbelievably funny, enjoyable and memorable. Without question one of my 5 favorite shows of all time. Then, in the blink of an eye, season six begins and there is a catastrophic switch in the show's jokes, set-ups, and characters. Every single joke became cringe-worthy, the set ups were horrid, Andy went from a hysterical clutz - to a mentally challenged 5 year old, Ron's character traits switched depending on every scene in every specific episode, Leslie went from funny/quirky to a 85% serious/15% Aspberger's sufferer. Tom lost 75% of his enthusiasm, Ben was shoved into the lead supporting actor's position when his character never has the depth to make that interesting. It just seemed like none of the characters grew, rather they just magnified each of their traits at all the wrong possible times. 

I'm assuming something changed within the show's production or staff due to the fact that every single one of this issues began in episode 1 and 2 of season 6. Not really sure what type of answers im expecting here, just wanted to know if you all felt the same. The first 5 seasons were amazing to watch, while 6 &amp; 7 were beyond horrible and a complete chore to finish.",PandR,1468127509,GaryQuarterTard,1,5,True,2016-07-10

I have *not* stopped thinking about that, which really brings up the question of why someone as talented as Johnathan Joss has never been approached to star in his own show.

Ken Hotate was arguably the most underutilized secondary character throughout all of Parks and Rec.  Joss *slayed* in every single scene he was in.  That on top of his years as John Redcorn, you would think that his potential in a leading role would have been noticed by someone.

Not to mention, how badass would it be to have a native American-led comedy on national TV?  I'm pretty sure that's never happened before, and it has potential to be fucking amazing.

I would have loved a Pokemon Go themed episode,"A quick synopsis of each of the character's plot lines, along with their corresponding Pokemon (similar to the Spirit Animal episode, solely going by the 151 originals):

Leslie: Becomes all giddy with excitement as townspeople flock to the parks moreso than ever, and fully supports the game. However, the idiotic townspeople raise hell in their public forums, calling for an outlaw of the game as the Pokemon ""poisoned our water supply, burned our crops, and delivered a plague unto our houses!"" Her Pokemon is Nidoqueen because she is a ""strong, empowered woman.""

Ben: Becomes completely enamored with the game, causing a stir among the townspeople that he is supporting the evil which comes back to Leslie. His Pokemon is Porygon because ""he's a nerd."" Ben mutters under his breath that Mewtwo is smarter.

Tom: Buys dozens of lures to try to attract and meet women. Fails miserably. His Pokemon is Meowth, due to his love of ""tangible items, and getting involved in hijinks that always ends in failure.""

Ron: Doesn't play the game, and struggles to correctly pronounce ""Pocket Men."" April assigns him Arcanine. Ron nods.

Ann Perkins: Is dating a guy at the time so she gets completely wrapped up in the game, complete with as much gear as one cares to talk about. Her Pokemon is Ditto, since she takes on the form of whomever she is with. Ann is offended, but Leslie says she is Ninetales, because she is a beautiful, ethnic, elegant fox.

Chris: Is leaps and bounds better than everyone at the game. Hatches many eggs a day on his ""morning, noon, evening, and night time 15 K runs!"" His Pokemon is Machoke. Chris cries and tells April it is ""litrally the best comparison I've ever received.""

Andy: Tries to teach April the ins and outs of the game, but she is extremely apathetic.Andy continues to play and succeeds. April tries to assign him a Pokemon, but before she can, Andy interrupts and exclaims that he is Scyther. We then go off to an aside, where Andy said ""Who wouldn't want to be Scyther! He has swords for hands! Nobody messes with Scyther."" Ben then comes around the corner and explains that praying mantises decapitate their partner after mating, causing Andy to reconsider. He never does.

April: As stated, doesn't become involved with the game, because ""everyone is doing it and I don't want to be part of the hivemind."" Secretly loves Pokemon, causing her to assign a spirit Pokemon to everyone. Assigns herself Gengar, because she would love to ""hypnotize people and eat their dreams while they sleep.""

Jerry: Joins Team Instinct. April assigns him Bulbasaur, because of the three starters Bulbasaur is the one people least care about. Jerry says it reminds him of Gayle's gardens.

Donna: Doesn't play the game, but has all of her boyfriends succeed in it for her. April assigns her Persian, because she is an elegant and beautiful Pokemon.

Recurring characters:

Animal control - go to parks to play the game on AR, try to use actual tools of theirs to catch Pokemon. ""There's a couple of Psyducks,"" mutters April.

Councilman Jamm - Somehow cheats in the game, and gets under Leslie's skin when it comes to the townspeople. April pulls Leslie aside and refers to him as Magikarp, since he keeps flopping around but never actually does any damage.

I just finished watching the show for the first time in my life. One hell of a ride.,"I just watched the series finale, and yes, manly tears were shed, but not for long. I have watched Greg Daniels' previous work in The Office (US version) and fell in love with the show. It had an amazing  cast, with a great romance and the finale sent me into emotional trauma. However, I didn't feel the ""need"" to cry in this finale.

I love this show, don't get it wrong, and I adore the show in its entirety. The second I saw the cast, I thought to myself: ""Huh, this show can be great"". And by god, it was. Tommy Timberlake is obviously the best character (with Ron coming in a very close 2nd), and the comedy was superb. I feel like the emotional side of the show wasn't really the main part (as it sort of was in The Office, along with the excellent comedy), and that Greg Daniels and the rest of the crew seemed to focus more on the excellent, amazing jokes. Seeing Jerry/Garry/Terry/Larry/Barry fail time after time in his daily life, seeing Ron dislike everything that has to do with anyone, seeing Tom's and Donna's amazing on-screen chemistry blossom and see the show in its entirety with all the inside jokes (I really need to get myself a copy of Cones of Dunshire), really improved my life.

I've seen many excellent comedy shows, such as Seinfeld, The Office, How I Met Your Mother and many more, but this show was something else. The excellent blend of comedy, emotion and chemistry between the actors was incredible, and it was truly, one hell of a ride.

**Total number of episodes with drunk characters:**
23

**Who was drunk the most:**
Leslie: 11 times

**Most ""drunk"" episode:**
""The Fight"" - 8 characters drunk at The Snakehole Lounge.  You can blame SnakeJuice on that one.

**Main Cast Members Never Drunk:**

My issue with P&amp;R. help!!!,"Hi. I am of a different nationality (not American). I have been watching a lot of Parks and Recreation lately and I couldn't help but wonder if some representations of Americans are fairly accurate. In the series, some Americans are portrayed to be incredibly dumb (beyond belief) while others really seem to be bigoted, as in the case of some shouting profanities during city open fora. I know Amy Poehler and the producers are smart people, who do not want to misrepresent people and so there should be some truth to these things (unless what Chris Pratt said, that the Parks people are just pretty high most of the time, is actually true). I come from developing country and frankly, I don't see a lot of normal individuals who are not in power reacting to petty issues and coming up with senseless arguments such as unreasonable opposition to good projects because of selfish personal reasons that are most of the time not promoting the common good of people. I don't want to insinuate hate by generalizing, I just want to be enlightened. Is this culture- specific to certain areas in America? Or are these nothing but hasty generalizations that are harming America's image? Or better yet, are these things not actually hinged on any truths and should be considered pure fiction?

In episode 14 of season 2, Tom says *Pawnee is the opposite of hip. People in this town are just now getting into Nirvana. I don't have the heart to tell them what's gonna happen to Kurt Cobain in 1994.*

Nirvana broke through in 1991 and if Pawnee is just getting into Nirvana, then their musical knowledge is about 19 years behind the rest of the world. Meaning that Parents Just Don't Understand is only a 3 year old song and the music of P.Diddy, BTNH and Ludacris hasn't even been made yet, from the perspective of the people who grew up in Pawnee.

Concern about the Mockumentary(ies),"So, the show is similar to ""The Office"" in the sense that it's a mockumentary, but this show only talks to the cameras in one on one interviews but they crew is never really acknowledged, For example in the last season of ""The Office"" there is an episode where Pam talks to the Mike guy, but the mockumentary crew for Parks and Rec is never acknowledged. No reason is given for why they are following them from when it started too when it stopped (Also keep in mind that in the time jump, cameras were still following them). The same thing goes for Modern Family but that is even more ridiculous because they are a ""Family"", so most of what is happening would have to be super personal. What is the mockumatary crews even doing? what is their purpose of filming, who are they sharing the footage with? I'm might be reading way too into this but I'm nearing the end of the office and it's the only show that notices the cameras. Can anyone give an explanation for this?

"I've been rewatching/bingwatching the series again ... is it just me or are most of the characters assholes, especially Leslie?","I find that except Ben and Jerry, and Ron kind of, everyone else seems to be quite an asshole.

April too is a dick as well, but has been more developed later into the series as someone who cares beneath it all. Donna wasn't as bad as everyone else, but she can still be a dick. 

But most of all, I'm surprised at Leslie. She wasn't that bad in the beginning, but while everyone else in the series have been growing more likeable and less of an ass (except to Gary/Jerry/Larry/Lenny/Terry/Barry), Leslie has been increasingly prominent in how selfish she is.

How Jerry got Gale...the key reference that I've never seen mentioned before!,"Now I know this has been thought about by many of us, and most of us have know about the reference to his penis size (the *largest* penis the doctor has *ever* seen). 

However, I have never heard the reference that might be the other key to the puzzle. In Season 6, EP1 (the second part of the London trip) Jerry mentions to Chris and Ann that he gained a lot of sympathy weight when Gale was first pregnant and that beforehand he looked a lot like Chris. 

&amp;nbsp;

So if we put together all of this info:

* Largest penis

* Looked like chris
* He can paint
* Play classical piano
* do magic
* He works hard
* Very loyal to his family 

It starts to make a lot of sense why and how he got a woman like gale to first fall for him. 

&amp;nbsp;

Reference is at 28:45 in the first episode of Season 6 (the time stamp is from Netflix)

Why I Dislike Ann Perkins [please actually read before downvoting],"I've never been quiet about my dislike for Ann Perkins as a character; I recently [voiced this in a thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/PandR/comments/3xzv4o/the_best_couple/cy9ipke) and was asked, not for the first time, why I felt this way. I've decided to write up my thoughts in the hope that I can show people my way of thinking (or at least to have something written down so that I don't have to keep writing it out every time).

I'll start with an exercise that I'm borrowing from [one of my favorite media reviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxKtZmQgxrI&amp;list=PL5919C8DE6F720A2D):

*Describe the following Parks and Recreation character WITHOUT saying what they look like, what their profession is, or what their role in the show is. Describe the character like you would to someone who had never seen the show.*

* **Ron Swanson**: deadpan; libertarian; stereotypically masculine

* **Chris Traeger**: upbeat; energetic; caring; health-conscious

* **April Ludgate**: sarcastic, aloof; dry; cold

* **Ann Perkins**: ...?

I think you see what I'm getting at with this. The more descriptive you can get about a person, the stronger their character is. You guys know these characters as well as I do, you know what makes them tic. But unless you've seen something that I haven't, the odd one out is going to be Ann Perkins.

That's because she doesn't have any depth as a character. She is a normal, bland, forgettable person, and once you take her out of the context of a) being a nurse, b) being Leslie's best friend, and c) being pretty, you're not left with much. Indeed, one of her only real character traits is that she gets subsumed in the characters of people she's dating.

To anyone saying that Ann is the straight man, that's correct, she is. That does not excuse her not being a fleshed-out character. Ben Wyatt is a perfect example of someone who can both serve as a straight man but also have his own quirks and idiosyncrasies that make him a real person. Ann Perkins doesn't have these. She's just...there. Most of the reasons people say they didn't like Mark Brendanawicz can be said of Ann. I don't know why there's such a disconnect there; all I can think is that it's because she's a hot girl, but who knows.

I have nothing against Rashida Jones. If I met Ann in real life I wouldn't dislike her at all. But as a character in a TV show, especially one as good as P&amp;R, she fails.

Finally, there's [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuLMCa0xrPc). Ann is a nurse, she went to school and studied medicine, and yet she doesn't know that the popular notion of the ""sugar rush"" [is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar_rush) [a](http://www.webmd.com/parenting/features/busting-sugar-hyperactivity-myth) [myth](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sugar&amp;redirect=no#Hyperactivity).

I think I've discovered why I like the earlier seasons more than the later ones.,"I have lived in small-town America (specifically SE Iowa) for the entire duration of my life, and I feel like the first few seasons of Parks and Rec captured what its like to live in the Midwest very well.  It was subtle, funny, and very, very accurate.  At least in my experience, it was the only show on Network TV that actually got the formula correct.

By the 4th season or so, Pawnee started to feel a lot like Los Angeles and by season six / seven, it seemed like the show was actually taking place in LA.  Andy has a popular kids show, Pawnee is hosting large concerts with popular bands, there are paparazzi and 24-hour local news outlets, political scandals involving city councilmen, gentrification.  All things that just plain don't happen in small town USA.  I feel like the show shifted and stopped focusing so much on the very thing that attracted me to it in the first place.

I can understand why this would be a total non-factor to most people, and I'm not suggesting that the later seasons don't have their own merit, it's just something I've wanted to discuss with people and haven't gotten the opportunity to.",PandR,1451191419,Saturninefilms,10,98,True,2015-12-26

First one wouldn't due to the fact that the Pawnee Parks Department as moved on, in 2017 Craig is running it, and it seems he's doing a great job, even as Leslie's backing for it.

The second one is shot with them moving, I doubt Ron would ever leave Pawnee.

And the third is gone because I doubt April and Andy would return to government work, neither would Ron (I know technically he is, but you get what I mean)

So while I would *love* a eighth season, it wouldn't make any sense. And for those who have watched the seventh season [spoiler] (#s ""it basically ends everything with no coming back"")

Season 3 gets rid of the immensely satisfying opening credits and that makes me sad.,"So I recently started watching the show and one of my favourite things about it is when the title appears in the starting credits it matches up perfectly with the music.

Then season 3 episode 1 starts and there's a previously on pandr which messes up the title sequence but fair enough I understand why it's there, even though I'm binge watching it on Amazon video and it has no need to be there. 

Then episode 2 starts the title is there and not even one word at a time like it should be and it's way before the usual music cue and I cannot believe it, so I jump straight on to episode 3 wait for the opening credits and it happens again, my favourite lovely little title music cue thing is gone and I don't like it.

Favorite episodes in each season?,"Reddit friends,

What are your favorite episodes from each season? Pick one or two from each season that you think are the best, most well done episodes from each season, 1-7. Additionally, name your favorite overall episode. 

My picks:

S1: Canvassing - season 1 is pretty rough, but this episode was one of the most tolerable. This is back when Leslie was the female Michael Scott, and the opening scene with Tom forgetting to hide the Easter eggs is gold.
S2: Practice Date - a classic, Leslie's first date with Dave was hilarious. Also arguably the best subplot of any episode with the office game of uncovering dirt.
and Ron and Tammy - no explanation needed. This one contains some of the best one liners in the shows history
S3: Flu Season - the April-Ann feud at its finest, and I loved Ron and Andy's bonding. Also, Chris's hypochondria is icing on the cake. 
and Andy and April's Fancy Party - this was the most impulsive and cheesy TV wedding of all time, and it completely worked. This episode perfectly encapsulates their relationship.
S4: Pawnee Rangers - The Ron and Leslie dynamic has always been great, but this was an all time high. Watching the struggle for power over trivial competitions always results in a funny episode.
S5: Leslie and Ben - I hate Jamm. So much. Alongside what may have been one of the greatest TV weddings ever, watching Ron punch him in the face was definitely in my top 3 favorite moments of the show.
S6: Moving Up - This could've been the finale in itself (though I'm happy it wasn't). One of the most well done retrospective episodes the show has done, though it pretty much invalidated the whole mockumentary setup.
And Ann and Chris - one of the best send-off episodes I've ever seen. They did t over do it with flashbacks of the show's earlier days, and it was a perfect mix of bittersweet and lighthearted.
S7: Leslie and Ron - I've always loved episodes centered around these two, but this was by far the best. P&amp;R has always been good at being emotional and hilarious. This episode exemplifies both at the same time.

Favorite overall: Ron and Tammy",PandR,1432176156,gfoster18,3,4,True,2015-05-20

My overactive imagination created an episode featuring Swanson while sleeping the other night.,"""Fools Gold"" 

I had a dream the other night where Ron Swanson was kidnapped by robbers and taken back to his cabin in the woods, demanding to know where his gold was.

On camera after the events, Ron giggling, ""I knew this day would come. However, I've been planning this for years. You see, I've setup this elaborate puzzle so that every time someone finds a piece, it's actually just a trigger mechanism to text my friends from Pawnee. It reads, ""I have been kidnapped. Do not be alarmed. Send law enforcement officers to the following address.""

You see after they've figured out the puzzle, it sends them to a room that in fact does contain some of my gold. The only problem is, when they lift it off the pedestal, they're locked in, making it quite easy for our men in blue to take them off to prison.""

I'm pretty sure the ringleader of the group is Mona-Lisa Saperstein who often during the episode will proclaim, ""Come on can we just kill him already cuz we're totally badass robbers and stuff."" Jean-Ralphio would also be one of the robbers.

There would be a scene with Tom saying to himself, ""Don't be the Sapersteins, don't be the Sapersteins. *Perd on the tv"" Insiders suggest the kidnappers are in fact Mona-Lisa and Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, children of local Pawnee investor Dr. Saperstein."" Oh come on! Seriously guys? Totally not cool."" Donna, lowering her glasses at Tom, ""I told you those two were trouble.""

Andy would make the arrest as Burt Macklin. Leslie would be super impatient and have to be held back by Ben the whole episode. April would show a surprising but heartfelt show of emotion and actually be worried about Ron, only at the end of the episode to be like, ""Whatever, I would have just killed them with my mind powers."" as she stares intensely at Mona-Lisa as they push her into the cop car. 

And of course Jerry would somehow have been dragged into the kidnappers group and be left inside the room at the episode, ""Guys. Guys? Come on guys I'm going to be late for pizza night!""",PandR,1432716568,dresdenreader,2,7,True,2015-05-27

Why couldn't they have worked in Chris Pratt's transformation during Season 6 into the plot?,"His Guardians of the Galaxy transformation only got a mention in the London episode where he says ""I stopped drinking beer"" and then it's never mentioned again.

Maybe it's rather silly to bring up, but seeing him go from a fat, messy haired neckbearded dork to a builtfat, short haired, kept facial hair but staying a dork was relatively unbelievable. I guess if it's kind of like how shows tend to hide and ignore actress pregnancies, but it would have been cool to have women suddenly getting all over Andy and he has to ignore them or shit like that",PandR,1433218912,[deleted],2,1,True,2015-06-02

Ann Perkins' Locket from Chris,"Hi Everyone!

I was wondering if anyone had any knowledge about the locket that Chris gives to Ann in S6Ep11 (New Beginnings). My SO's birthday is coming up, and I heard her make a comment about how she liked it, so I'd like to get it for her.

Any info about it, or where I may be able to find it, would be GREATLY appreciated, and it would save me lit-erally so much time. Thanks again, my beautiful tropical fish.

EDIT: Thanks everyone  so much for your suggestions! I was able to get a picture from the show of exactly what the necklace looked like, and Ill try to upload it later today, just in case that helps.

What is the general consensus on Season 7 and the series finale on here? Because I felt both were quite weak.,"Maybe it's because I don't really watch network TV (P&amp;R is the first network sitcom I have watched since The Office ended) and instead watch cable where shows typically are darker.

I get that P&amp;R was a really cheerful and positive show. But everyone's lives literally ended exactly how they wanted, absolutely perfectly.

I thought that maybe they were switching gears with having Tom's Bistro fail, but of course he just turns all of his business failures into a best-selling book and he becomes famous after all. 

They had already turned April into Leslie 2, but then of course she just decides to go from staunchly anti-child to having 2 kids (and we still don't learn what happened to Andy)

And of course everyone knew that Leslie would be president by the end.

I mean it just seems like P&amp;R had turned from a great overall show in it's first 4-5 seasons or so that anyone could enjoy, to the type of show in Season 6 and 7 that mainly caters to suburban middle aged mothers who want a sweet family show to watch with her kids before bed. Hell, at least some of the earlier episodes were TV-14. The final 3 seasons were all TV-PG

I'm sure I'll probably get beat down here with this opinion because most of you guys who watched this show probably loved the sappiness of it all, but I'm just curious if I'm the only person who thought this way",PandR,1433391607,HelloGuysIAmNewHere,5,0,True,2015-06-04

Andy comforts Ben and says something like ""If you're anything like me and April, three weeks from now, you'll be married"".

But every single person who was parks director hated their job, and hated everyone they worked with. [Then a long pause] Are we going to hate each other some day?"" One scene later and Leslie states, ""Why do people eat anything other than breakfast food? Because people are idiots Leslie.""

If that's not foreshadowing, then I don't know what is. (If you are unaware to what I'm referencing, in the final season of the show, there is a ""mysterious"" feud between Leslie and Ron. Ultimately it ends up with them making up, and walking out the door saying a famous quote, but in the opposite context. ""Why do people eat anything other than breakfast food? Because people are Idiots Ron."" A quote that was said in, you guessed it, JJ's Diner).

Mystery song from Galentine's Day Ep. 16 Season 2,"Hello fellow P&amp;R fans. I'm new to this particular subreddit but I was hoping someone might have an answer to this mystery. 

I was rewatching the series in lieu of season 7 being on Netflix as of yet, and in the episode stated in the title, Mouse Rat plays a gig for the Seniors' Valentine's Day Dance. During the dance, while a lot of character development is happening, they play a song that goes,

A quick google search reveals that the song is not a cover, nor can be found on any website. I checked scarecrowboat.com as well and while there are covers from the episode on there along with ""Sex Hair,"" this song is not. I can't find any mention of the song anywhere!

"Let's point out all the little ""self reference"" moments we know!","I'm sorry I couldn't find a better title for this, because this is not always considered ""meta humor"" in my opinion. But Parks and Rec has a lot of moments where a joke or a small nod pays off much later in either the series or the episode, and it usually takes multiple views of the series or the episode to figure it out.

A few examples:

* The date that Ann set up Leslie with to keep her away from Justin on season 2's ""The Set Up"" pointed out that Leslie could have triplets ""right off the bat"" when he peformed an MRI on her.
* April buys Andy a Reggie Wayne jersey in ""Christmas Scandal"", which he later wears for their wedding. This one may be a bit blunt and obvious, but as a guy who doesn't have any football airing in his country, it took me a rerun or two to notice that, before Andy actually pointed that out when he met Reggie Wayne later in the series.
* In ""End of the World"", Leslie mentions that Ben and her are in good company with other pairs of people who never hang out, one of the examples being G/L/T/B/Jerry and April. A bit later in the episode, Jerry and April hang out along with Andy and Natalie to help Andy check stuff off of his bucket list by filming an action scene featuring Burt Macklin and Janet Snakehole.

2. Season 2: Leslie is dating Justin Theroux's character. She mentions something to the camera about happy endings and how she wishes Romeo and Juliet to be together or for Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt to be back together. She then says. ""I just want Jen to be happy. Stay away from John Mayer."" Does anyone else find it funny that Jennifer Anison is now married to Justin Theroux?

"On the final, love this show, but kinda something that has bugged me for a long time (Spoilers)","So in season 2 or so, Andy gives Tom 1000$ so he can invest in the snakepit.  He then makes massive amounts of money off that, and opens his 720 business, that fails, but he still had money to blow(10,000$), next he comes up with his Swagger company, which as of the current episode(Episode 5 of Season 6 I am on) is doing well, even with competition he's making serious bank.

The part that bothers me is that, given how freely Andy gave money to Tom, to help support his dreams...Tom never mentions this, which bugs me. Andy doesn't, cause we know how he is, nice guy, and probably has even forgotten.

But really, I know Andy ""gave"" Tom the 1000$, but any decent person would remember this when they made it successful and either pay him back, offer him shares / a stake in the company as he helped him make it, overall.  Considering Andy &amp; April don't live wonderfully financially, I just am surprised it was never brought up by Tom or April.  Still plenty of episodes left in the season, I suppose.

[Theory] Chris Traeger has an eating disorder at the beginning of the show.,"At the beginning of Chris Traeger's character arc in Parks and Rec, we are introduced to an obsessively health-conscious individual. While his obsession with healthy eating is taken as a joke, he initially shows symptoms of a relatively unknown eating disorder, [orthorexia nervosa](https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/orthorexia-nervosa).

Let's look at some of the symptoms and causes of orthorexia. First off, there's this tidbit: 

&gt;Orthorexia appears to be motivated by health, but there are underlying motivations, which can include safety from poor health, compulsion for complete control, escape from fears, wanting to be thin, improving self-esteem, searching for spirituality through food, and using food to create an identity.

Let's look at this a little closer. Does this sound like anyone you know? 

&gt;Orthorexia appears to be motivated by health, but there are underlying motivations, which can include safety from poor health, compulsion for complete control, escape from fears

That exactly describes Chris during season 3. Chris reveals that, as an infant, he was diagnosed with a rare blood disorder and was expected to only live three weeks. His obsession with health stems from his very real fear that he could still die prematurely. His ambition becomes to be the first person to live 150 years, all stemming from the fact that he nearly died as an infant. Safety from poor health? Check. Escape from fears? Check. As for the bit about complete control, remember when he was depressed and obsessively exercising/moving? Yeah, that fits the bill right here. 

Let's take a look at another quote from the page linked. 

&gt;Following a healthy diet does not mean you are orthorexic, and nothing is wrong with eating healthfully.  Unless, however, 1) it is taking up an inordinate amount of time and attention in your life; 2) deviating from that diet is met with guilt and self-loathing; and/or 3) it is used to avoid life issues and leaves you separate and alone.

A lot of people may argue that Chris is just a very healthy eater. However, his healthy eating fits all three critera above. It's to the point where he tries to change what is served at city hall to be healthier, getting rid of unhealthy options rather than just having them serve healthier options alongside the unhealthy ones. He is shown to have a fundamental lack of understanding at other people's disinterest in healthy eating, to the point where he makes a vegetable loaf instead of a cake for Andy and April's wedding. Him not freaking out over drinking a cup of regular eggnog is a huge point of character development. 

What does this all mean? Well, it changes his character arc. He's no longer just a guy who is learning to accept that he's getting older and to enjoy the little things. He's a guy who starts out deep in denial about an eating disorder, who gradually learns to recover. As the webpage states, recovered orthorexics still eat healthily, but allow themselves to deviate from their diet. 

I'm eager to hear your thoughts! I just stumbled upon this new eating disorder last night while I was reading a blog, and realized how perfectly it fit Chris and just had to share with you lovely people. ",PandR,1435681498,katzgoboom,17,61,True,2015-06-30

A case as to why everyone should hate Chris Traeger,"Everyone should hate Chris. He is by far the worst more pathological characters on the show. ‚ÄúBut what about Jam or that terrible horrible god awful campaign manager?‚Äù Jam is funny but Chris is equally as bad as that horrible devil of a campaign manager. She at least wore her horribleness on the outset. Chris is an American Psycho level two faced manipulator who gets off on peoples sorrows and his masterful manipulation of people‚Äôs emotions.


I present 3 cases as to why Chris is such a terrible person:



I.       Chris is a grade A hypocrite who abuses his power to satisfy his sadistic tendencies.

A.       Chris is a HUGE hypocrite. We will start with the trial of Leslie Knope to illustrate this. Chris flat out lies saying ‚ÄúI was only doing my job, it wasn't personal‚Äù. LIAR! What is Chris‚Äôs job? He is city manager he is there to basically instill that his budgetary policies he put in place previously stay in effect. Does part of this budgetary plan involve spending thousands of dollars on a trial for a city employee who *broke no actual laws or official rules*? Wait I thought less than a year ago Pawnee was bankrupt? Yet Chris Traeger wants to spend money doing a thorough investigation and holding a full two day trial for this garbage? These actions do not make sense for someone who is ""just doing their job"". 

Also the fact that as a result of his expensive witch hunt Ben is fired. Now the city has to spend upwards of $100,000 to hire a new person to fill Ben‚Äôs position. Hiring someone for a position like this will require vetting, and  a thorough interview process. This will cost a *serious* amount of money, which Pawnee cannot afford. Chris wasn't doing his job, he was satisfying a sadistically charged power trip. Yes, Chris gets off on his power and is eager to inflict suffering on anyone he can. Just look at Jerry



B.      So the real hypocrisy and sadism comes out full force with Jerry. He knows he can execute this on him because no one will listen to Jerry, he is simply preying on the weak as all sadistic psychopaths do. ‚ÄúBut all Chris did was date his daughter!‚Äù No, he didn't he tortured Jerry telling him way too many details of his relationship about his daughter. 

Even after Jerry told Chris not to tell him this stuff, what does Chris do? He launches a full ‚Äúinvestigation‚Äù into his relationship with Jerry‚Äôs daughter, and *forces* Jerry to be a part of this. He is abusing his power for personal gain at this point, much worse than Ben or Leslie ever did. Ben and Leslie *never* wasted tax payer money with their relationship. Chris clearly is by wasting a full day of 5 government employees, this amounts to over $1000 if not more, for what is at best a personal problem but is more likely an exercise in tormenting loyal government employee (Jerry). 

 Not only that but Chris‚Äô treatment of Jerry is bonafide sexual harassment. He not only tells Jerry about all the sexual details of his relationship but he also forces Jerry to watch him make out and grope his daughter all before telling him he is going to have sex with her that night. This is simply sick sick sick behavior. There is no stating ‚ÄúChris just was being Chris and didn‚Äôt mean any harm‚Äù No, look at the way Chris acts in all these scenes; he is *completely* getting off on rubbing Jerry‚Äôs face in it.




II.       Chris always wanted Leslie fired:

A.       All of this stems from the episode ‚ÄúThe Trial of Leslie Knope‚Äù where Chris acts extremely vicious towards Leslie in a seemingly uncharacteristic turn. I mean he straight up crucifies Leslie. 

""Why? He doesn't hate Leslie right?"" Wrong. Leslie is the only person who is smart enough to catch on to his game. He knows most people in local government do not care enough and he can get away with his horrible sadistic game. As soon as he comes in he wants Leslie gone. He personally singles her out to be fired. Then he purposefully puts her working with Ben as soon as he realizes their chemistry together. He makes up his rule about co-workers not being able to date (which is only *his* rule, there is nothing in the Pawnee government prohibiting their relationship). This is an attempt to get them together and he will put all the blame on Leslie, which he intentionally and obviously does in Leslie‚Äôs trial. At the end when Ben takes the blame and resigns in disgrace, Chris takes one last vicious swipe to get Leslie to take the fall and cries all over Ben in an attempt to get him not to take the blame and kill off Leslie once and for all.  






III.       Chris is a not so secret womanizer and misogynist.

A.       Chris‚Äô relationship with Melissa is strong evidence of another point. Chris is *super* shallow. Lets look at the evidence here. 

Jerry asks Chris out to lunch with his daughter and he tells him to screw off. He then gets one look at Melissa and his tune changes immediately. This is all just based on looks.

 ‚ÄúSo what every guy likes pretty girls that doesn't make him a womanizer‚Äù. True, but what does is his relationship with Ann. I will state this, he never actually broke up with Ann. Ann was just another victim of Chris‚Äôs womanizing game. 

What was Chris‚Äôs job previous to settling in Pawnee? He moved around from town to town fixing budgets and what not. He is probably hooking up with women in every town, and probably knows how to break up with them. But no, he doesn't want to break up with them. He leaves them like he did with Ann; he leaves them thinking he will be back. He gets off on this. Notice how he is still happy almost laughing at Ann when she comes to see him at his apartment. This is because he is a psychotic sadist who gets off on humiliating women. 

This desire to humiliate women is part of his hatred for Leslie Knope. He knows that she is a smart strong woman and thus he wants to tear her down. This is the whole reason he goes out of his way spending millions of tax payer dollars to crucify Leslie publicly in an effective attempt to prevent her from elevating her position in the upcoming election., and possibly even make people reconsider women working in government period. 





Of course it should be stated that Chris‚Äô reign of misogyny and sadism could have been ended by Jerry. If Jerry had stepped up and presented the evidence that Chris had been sexually harassing him and wasting tax payer money for his own personal relationships, Chris would have been fired if not executed via burning at the stake in the supermarket parking lot (which he clearly deserves). So yeah here is another one you can blame on Jerry.  

TL;DR: Chris Traeger is a sadistic misogynist who gets off on exerting his power over women and humiliating those lesser than him. ",PandR,1416526003,megatom0,6,0,True,2014-11-20

I just started watching the series for the first time and I'm several episodes in and I just find myself cringing at almost everything Leslie does. I recognize this is supposed to be part of her humor but gosh, I'm having a hard time. Does it get any better? Does she stop being completely naive at some point? I'm really trying to like the show but I'm worried that I'll have to force myself through it. I'm liking nearly everything that doesn't involve Leslie but it's probably not good to dislike the main character, right?

What's your opinion of April Ludgate?,"I would love to get the opinion of my fellow Perd-verts on this issue. As the show has progressed, I have fallen in love with most of the characters more and more. The only person I don't like as much as I did initially is April. 


I used to really like April. In the beginning of the show she was one of my favorite characters. She was apathetic, mean, and lazy- a perfect anchor to Leslie's relentless optimism, and Andy's youthful energy. But as the show has progressed, April has evolved from being apathetic to being extremely zany and weird. This zaniness has made it really difficult for her to have an actual conversation with other characters in the show. I'm half-assing this post so I didn't come up with any example clips, but if you watch group scenes from later seasons, you'll notice April will say something totally off-the-wall, and the other people will ignore it because there's basically nothing they can say to such an insane comment. It's unrealistic, and it's also a mark of bad writing for her character. 


It seems to me that April now fills two purposes: to say completely wacky shit that can inherently only be funny as a one-liner, or to ""snap people out of it"" when they need a reality check. April now is so zany, that only when she says something serious do people actually pay attention to what she is saying. 


So what do you think, fellow Parks and Recs fans? I know this is probably going to be really unpopular because it seems that April gets a lot of love on this sub. 


Also, secondary question- I've stated that I don't think April's character has evolved well. Are there any other characters that you think have not aged for the better over the course of the show?

**TRIVIA**  
* Characters who appear in every season: Leslie, Tom, Andy, Ron, Ann, April, Jerry, Donna, Shauna, Dr. Harris, Burly, Chang.  
* Characters who make the top 10 in every season: Leslie, Tom, Andy, Ron, Ann, April, Jerry.  
* Characters who make the top 5 in every season: Leslie and Tom. April never made the top 5 until Season 6, when Andy, Ann, and Chris were each missing for multiple episodes.  
* Ron is never ranked higher than 5th.  
* Only Leslie has appeared in all 110 episodes. Tom, Ron, and April appeared in 109 episodes, Jerry in 108, Donna in 106, and Andy in 102.  
* Most lines in an episode: Leslie, with 125 in ""Leslie's House"".  
* Fewest lines by Leslie: 34 in ""Two Parties"" (fourth place).  
* Leslie was 1st place in every Season 6 episode.  
* Episodes where Leslie wasn't 1st place: ""Rock Show"" (Andy), ""Galentine's Day"" (Andy), ""Ron &amp; Tammy: Part 2"" (Ron), ""Media Blitz"" (Ben), ""April and Andy's Fancy Party"" (Andy), ""Meet n Greet"" (Andy), ""Dave Returns"" (Dave), ""Two Parties"" (Andy, then Chris, then Ben), ""Swing Vote"" (Andy).  
* Andy sometimes got lines when he was audibly singing onstage between the lines of other people's conversations. This contributed to him coming 1st in certain episodes (but not Meet n Greet, where he didn't sing), and gave him about 30 extra lines in the series that weren't conversational.  
* Most lines by a single-episode character: Raul, with 77 in ""Sister City"".  
* Most lines by a guest star: Jamm with 284.  
* The guest star in the most episodes is Perd (24), followed by Councilman Howser (18).  
* Donna is the only regular who never made the top 3 in any episode.  
* The tie-breaker in the ranked list is who was in more episodes.  
* Leslie got over 100 lines in an episode 13 times, all of them in the first three seasons. Nobody else ever cracked 100 lines.  
* Extra-length episodes are counted as one episode.  
* Leslie averaged 73.68 lines per episode. The runners-up are Ben (34.34), Dave (34.33), Justin (30.5), Tom (27.98), Andy (27.77), Ann (27.65), Ron (23.17), Tammy 2 (20.71), Chris (20.26), Bobby (20.25), and April (19.89). Jerry averages 8.37 lines, and Donna averages 7.16.  
* The Douche has 69 lines.  
* Predictions for after Season 7 (the final season): Ben surpasses Andy and finishes 3rd in the series. Ron surpasses Ann, but April does not. The rest of the Top 14 remains the same. Craig breaks into the top 20.  ",PandR,1417771003,WalterEagle,29,107,True,2014-12-05

&amp;nbsp;


""Where I live, there are a lot of apathetic people, people who don‚Äôt care at all about what they do or how they do it. They let the world wash over them and barely notice anyone else is even there. Leslie Knope is not one of these people. She cares about everything and everyone in our town. I don‚Äôt know how she does it. People come to her with the pettiest, stupidest problems, and she cares - like really, actually cares - what happens to them. And if you‚Äôre lucky enough to be her friend, your life gets better every day. She spends every waking moment thinking of new ways to make her friends happy. There is something wonderful about seeing someone who has found her true purpose on earth. For some people, I guess that‚Äôs being an astronaut or a hotdog eating champion. For Leslie, her true purpose on earth, her true meaning, is making people‚Äôs lives better. That‚Äôs what I love about her, and that‚Äôs why she deserves this award.

So I got someone in Secret Santa at work is a proper Ron Swanson type...epitome of a man. Plus he has great facial hair.

So I'm looking for a Swanson-related gift that will either arrive in the next week by delivery or which I can buy in a shop in London. I'm in the UK.

Any ideas? Seen a few things online but they won't arrive in time.

Any shops I can try in London?

Ideally has to be ¬£5 or less but will go up to ¬£10 if necessary as he's a top guy.

I was thinking about how characters act in the Parks and Rec Universe...,"And it seems to me that as the show progresses, the characters become more animated...Shauna tweep becomes much more insecure, Perd becomes much weirder, and Joan's sex addiction comes into play and spirals out of control. Now this could be easily explained by the show naturally fleshing out and exhibiting character development, but what if it was all in Leslie's head?

In the beginning of the series, shes so confused about herself she doesn't bother paying attention to the traits of any of her peers. However, once she meets Anne, she slowly begins to becomes more secure and sure of herself, that she allows herself to look beyond herself and pick up on the unique characteristics of the people around her. 

I apologize if this sounds like a stupid conspiracy theory like in Rugrats how all of angelica's friends are actually her imagination, I'm currently running on minimal sleep, and in the midst of studying for my finals, I started thinking of Parks and Rec . hope this at least sparked some interest

Opinion on Jerry Gergich,"I must confess, I am a newcomer to this show. I've heard plenty about it and recently decided to start watching it. Totally understand the praises it's gotten. I have just recently began season 3, and planning on eating it all up pretty soon.

However, one particular detail has stuck out to me, which is Jerry's portrayal in the show. I understand that he is made to be the target of make-fun jokes, and pretty much the overall punching bag to exaggerated effect.

Nevertheless, it has taken me some time to truly embrace this role of Jerry and actually play along with it, because Jim O'Heir plays him as a simple and genuinely nice guy who doesn't really seem to be as incompetent as others make him out to be (just slightly clumsy, but well-meaning). So, the situations involving the department making fun of Jerry just seem like bullying, and since the character of Jerry does invoke some sympathy, it seems more mean than actually funny.

I am willing to give the show some credit to successfully change tone and develop characters in suitable directions (evolution from Season 1, and Andy Dwyer, respectively), so I still haven't given up on the Jerry-related humor. I'm just wondering if anyone else has felt the same way, and if you feel like this is something that changes as the series progresses?

For example, Mark revealing that Jerry was adopted, and the guys dissing on Jerry's ""murinal"" felt a bit too much for me. Found those moments more pity-inducing than truly laugh-out-loud funny.

Park Safety seemed to me a pretty optimistic episode in this regard, since it is the first one where the department at least realizes to some extent it has been a bit mean to Jerry, and it makes a point of giving Jerry a talking head moment where it shows that he is pretty much okay with the treatment he gets, in a ""joke's on them"" situation due to his retirement plan.",PandR,1419488652,theLostio,9,0,True,2014-12-25

Listing of inconsistencies in multiple viewings,"Not that I'm some kind of super-observant genius, and I'm sure many of you have noticed the same things, but these things have stood out to me now that I've watched the series about a dozen times on Netflix:

-- Ron wears suits to work in the first season, and almost never after that.

-- In the episode 2x10 ""Hunting Trip,"" Ron berates Tom for not getting a hunting license. In the episode 6x06 ""Filibuster,"" he jokes with Donna about not caring about having a hunting license.

-- Eagleton is said to be ten miles away in season 1, but in later seasons it's shown to be right next to Pawnee and even once part of (and later reabsorbed into) Pawnee).

-- In 1x06 ""Rock Show,""  Leslie meets with the Eagleton town manager for advice on how to build a park on Lot 48. This is something she would NEVER do in subsequent seasons.


I love finding inconsistencies like this in shows. Can anyone else point some out?",PandR,1420380760,PepsiPerfect,28,4,True,2015-01-04
Jerry isn't as unlucky as we would love to think. (Math and bad grammar inside.),"Aside from have the best home life out of all of the parks and rec characters, he doesn't have as many unlucky moments we are led to believe. In season 5 episode 9, ""Ron and Diane"" they are going to jerry dinner and they had put a dollar in a box for every time jerry had done something funny. 


The total amount of money they had was 518 dollars. Assuming they are at work 5 days out of the week that is approx. 260 days at work a year. (52 weeks x 5 days a week, before holidays.) 


Now we know there were 4 people going to Jerry dinner. (Donna, April, Andy, Tom ) that being said we can assume more than one dollar was being out I. The donation box for each embarrassing thing jerry did. Even if one dollar was donated per goof were sitting at only about 2 screw ups per day. (518/260 =1.99) We can assume that number being less than that however because if all of them were present, they would all donate a dollar. 


TL;DR: jerry screws up a lot less then we think he really does.

Ron Swanson Spinoff,I am sure someone has posted this already but I am going to post it anyway. I would love a Ron Swanson show.

He could have wacky helpers at his wood shop who he puts up with because they remind him of april and leslie. Guest stars could come on and order things from his woodshop.

As our final season approaches...,"With the final season approaching, I thought it would be especially appropriate for this subreddit to show solidarity in reflecting on the show that's given us so much these past 5 years. I'm posting this thread to see what you guys would think about a weekly rewatch and discussion, starting with Season 1, and ending with Season 6, just in time for the premiere of the final season.


**Why would I want to do this?**
There's a lot of time between now and the season premiere ([which sources say will probably be in January of 2015](http://insidetv.ew.com/2014/05/21/parks-and-recreation-season-7-final-michael-schur/)). I know I'm going to get antsy, and the best cure for my angst has always been reliving the past and talking about it with others.

**Okay... but what else?**
Besides the weekly discussions, I'm personally willing to put in time linking to past recaps/reviews, extra scenes and special features, and other fun things relevant to the episodes of the week. You'd be surprised how much is out there.

**So how would it work?**
I'll make a (rough) schedule for each week of which episodes we should plan on watching. Once a week, a new discussion thread will be stickied, where we'll get to talk about our favorite moments and character development, link to all our favorite gifs, check out other goodies, etc.

By my count, there are 112 episodes to get through, and about 32 weeks (probably more) until [when I expect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-season_replacement) the Season 7 premiere will air. That averages to about 3.5 eps a week. Of course the specifics are something we could all decide. (I was actually thinking about having all of Season 1 in a week)


So what do you think guys? I think this is a great chance to keep our community alive and show support for the show to anyone who happens to be watching.

Parks and Re-watch Weekly Episode Discussions,"We're doing it! On Tuesday (6/10), /r/PandR will be joining in solidarity as we welcome the final season of Parks and Recreation. The plan is to rewatch the entire series, and (hopefully) end right in time for Season 7's premiere, around January.


Every week, on **Tuesday** and **Friday**, discussion threads will be posted and pinned. The pace will likely be **two episodes per discussion thread**, which comes out to 4 episodes per week. Besides discussing the episodes, I'll try and grab relevant gifs, reviews/recaps, and provide links to (legal) clips of specific scenes you may want to see.

**The first week is special:** I'll be posting a discussion thread for Season 1 as a whole this Tuesday, and then we'll move on to Season 2 the next Tuesday, with the regular 2 eps/discussion pace.

[SPOILER] Re-watched the Season 6 finale and I think there is more to a certain character than most people realized [SPOILER],"All of us that have already watched the Season 6 finale knows that the final scene jumps ahead 3 years.  Leslie is rushing around the 3rd flood of the Parks Department and we are introduced to a character that is even more incompetent than Jerry/Gary/Larry/Terry.  We are introduced to Ed, a character played by Jon Hamm.  

He walks into the already bustling room and when asked where the file is he replies with a smile, ""I'm sorry Ms. Knope, I've lost the file, it's gone.""  

This prompts Leslie to fire him, and he then says, again with a smile, ""I understand, thank you for the literally hundreds of opportunities you've given me.  Goodbye everyone!  It's been a great three years!""

His stress-free, seemingly always happy disposition, as well as the cadence and tone of his speech, leads me to believe that he is in some way related to Chris Traeger.  I can picture an incompetent Chris answer the same questions in the exact same way.  Think about when Chris would try to spin something that was terrible into something positive.  He always said it so upbeat, and would never lie about a situation, exactly like how Ed says it.

Has anyone else noticed?,"I just finished binge watching the first five seasons of Parks and Recreation (ok, not all at once but over the span of two weeks).  It is literally, the funniest show I have ever seen!

"If I ever get married, I will have a Parks and Recs themed wedding.","If I do end up getting married to a significant other, I thought about what would it be like to have a Parks and Recs wedding.

I'll invite family and friends to attend a supposed house-warming party without being aware that it is a surprise wedding party ala Andy and April's wedding since I'm not too keen on traditional weddings that would cost thousands of dollars. I would probably have the following:

*A DJ Roomba as the wedding DJ

*Bacon with all kinds of meat as main course meal with waffles for dessert

*Mouserat tribute band

*The two gay penguins as wedding cake toppers

*Ron Swanson wearing cornrows and a silk dressing gown as the marriage celebrant

*Marshmallow guns as gifts for the wedding guests

Something seems wrong with this season.,"This season of Parks and Recreation seems to be off, somehow. And it's not about the weird NBC scheduling stuff, it's the content.

Other than the Recall Vote, which is now done, what story line is there? It seems like each episode is just a little vignette that doesn't really go anywhere, like a completely self contained plot. Each character or small group of characters go through some story, and it's usually summed up nicely at the end. It seems like Seinfeld to me.

Also, the seasons leading up to this have seemed completely normal and believable in terms of how a normal city government would work. There are some quirky times, like things getting destroyed carelessly, but overall, nothing is that out of the ordinary. Except this season. Councilman Jamm is the height of absurdity, and there is no way someone that outrageously neglectful of rules and procedure would be allowed to stay in a city council, let alone being allowed to run the tables against Leslie all the time. It's almost bordering on satire, and it isn't really that funny.

Just a bit of ranting, I don't know if anyone else feels this way, but I wanted to share my opinion. I still really like the show, I just hope this season gets better.",PandR,1384807716,jcwitte,4,0,True,2013-11-18

My Thoughts on the exits of Ann &amp; Chris &amp; how it might parallel with the exit of Mark.,"Mark Brendanawicz seemed like the character what Leslie was designed to be with eventually. At least on paper it might have been the plan when the show started during season 1. The thing is, lots of bad ideas happened during season 1: Leslie bad at her job; Andy the un-lovable loser; Ann with no personality; Mark with a marginal personality.

Then season 2 came along and by the end of it had solved a lot of the problems of the show: Leslie was good at her job, the comedy coming from other people's reactions to her rather the comedy being generated at her failed to do a good job; Andy stops doing bad boyfriend stuff without losing his bumbling; Mark exits the show and Ben gets added to the show.

Boom, now Leslie has her soulmate, and her interactions with Ben are great. Ben is great. Andy gets paired with April and that's fun. Tom is allowed to grow also and that's fun to watch. Donna and Jerry/Larry are filled in more and that great to watch. To me Ann and Chris have always been the so-so characters. The reason I'm sad to see them leave the show is because Leslie and Ben lose their best friends, which is tough to handle.

But if characters leaving the show means new characters have to come in, and if Mark leaving meant the entrance of Ben, then I'm hopefully that the exits of Ann &amp; Chris mean the entrances of 1 or 2 new characters that we soon will make us say ""I cannot imagine the show without them!""",PandR,1384905500,paradox28jon,4,4,True,2013-11-19

It started out somewhat realistic, but over time all the townspeople characters just became caricatures of barely functioning adults that act like spoiled, petulant children most of the time.

It's dragged the show down for me a little as I can't understand why Leslie loves the town so much and fights for the well being of it's citizens when they are all just assholes to her.

Is recalling Leslie a bad decision?,"I believe the decision from the writers to recall Leslie is a bit drastic and may affect Leslie story lines negatively in the future. We spent the entire of Season 4 putting Leslie into office, and the whole Parks department went through so much to help Leslie win the election. It seems a bit drastic to dedicate an entire season into getting Leslie to become Councilwoman and then dismantling it a year later.

Most importantly, I believe that Leslie's time as Councilwoman provided her with the best written story lines throughout the show. Her feud with Jamm is one of the most entertaining bits to watch. The 2 best episodes of this season so far IMO, ""Fluoride"" and ""Cones of Duneshire"", involve Leslie competing with Jamm. Some of the best episodes of the show also showcase Leslie doing her job as councilwoman.

I know that the show is on its sixth season, and so my question for you all is: does Parks and Rec still have the ""magic"" or did it stagnate in later seasons?

Parks and Rec is arguably one of the greatest comedy shows in history,"Hey guys, just wanted to share with you that I truly love this show. I'm glad there is a sub reddit for it! 

Unlike other tv series, especially comedy shows, Parks and Rec gets better with every season. I just love all the characters so much, they are brilliantly written und acted, sometimes it feels as if I would know these people in real life and were friends with all of them. Also every single character is likeable in it's own way and the show is just so funny, intelligent and original. I think that those achievements are something that the creators and writers of the show can truly be proud of.

Theres one thing though wich I'm not looking forward to - I'm really sad that Chris and Ann are moving away, I love them both so much... Especially when I think about Leslie and Ann - what will Leslie do without her? They are such good friends and so perfect with each other! But I think the writers will find a satisfying way to let the characters go, I have great faith in them as they never, ever let me down over the course of the show.

Yeah, so I just wanted to share my endless love for Parks and Recreation.

Ann Perkins! Why I will not really be missing her leaving our beloved Pawnee.,"After a few seasons I have taken note of Ann, and have a few thoughts I thought I'd get off my chest. I'm interested to see what /r/PandR has to say.

I first wanted to title this: Ann Perkins! The most mundane citizen in Pawnee, but I thought I'd go in a different direction. So, please bare with me. When getting down to brass tacks I have a few feelings, and inquires about our beautiful naive sophisticated new born baby.

What brough Ann Perkins to Pawnee? In six seasons we still have yet to figure that out. Andy? Pawnee St. Joseph Hospital? Who knows... What we do know is that Ann adapts to whomever she is dating. (S. 5  ep. 5) So, it wouldn't surprise me if she flocked to Pawnee for Andy or whatever guy she was dating before him. Which brings up another question: How many men do you think she was with before Andy? Any who- she was clearly cool with the idea of moving to Indianapolis only after being with Chris for a few months. Would it surprise you if she moved because of a guy?


Moreover, after years of never being single I felt that she was quite dependent on dating that when she finally because single she literally started dating herself. Then after a few weeks of dating herself she concludes that she wants to have a child. Is Ann conveying that she is also dependent on always needing someone in her life? What does this really say about Perkins? I almost feel bad for her. Maybe something happened to her when she was younger to where she developed some type of complex.

When thinking of her, and wanting to call her mundane perhaps mundane isn't the right word. I know for sure that the right word isn't interesting. I am aware that she doesn't have a larger than life personality compared to some of her other co-workers, but it just don't get her. Often I find myself responding to her talking heads with a , ""Cool, Ann."" or. ""Okay, Ann."" I'm trying to think of a really juicy quote off the top of my head, but I can't. One that comes lose was in season two- episode twenty-three ""The Master Plan"" where Ann in an intoxicated state at the Snake Hole Lounge talked about how she loved, loved, loved Andy, and how discontent she was when Andy was finally getting his shit together. Instead of being happy for him she thinks its bullshit. Then later that night she ends up making out with Chris- then begin to date- then she gets dumped- but since she has never been turned down before, and the fact that Chris is so nice she had no idea it happened.

Am I looking too far into Ann Perkins‚Äô character development? Most Likely. Should I just continue to bite my lip until she leaves Pawnee in November? Yes. Do I honestly think we will not be missing her as much as all the hype is making it? You bet your sweet ass. With Andy coming back, and with the addition of reoccurring characters like Donna‚Äôs doppelganger, Billy Eichner I think we will be more than okay.

TL;DR- I'm not huge on Ann. I will not miss her. 

Oh my god. I just wasted a lot of your time. I am so. So. Sorry.

Does Pawnee even deserve Leslie Knope?,"Leslie does so much for the city, yet no one except for her closest friends even recognizer her accomplishments. It actually makes me sad seeing all the citizens and the rest of the city so incompetent. 

On a side note, I don't understand Councilman Howser. He seems like a smart guy so I have no idea why he never defends Leslie. He lets Jamm and the other two incompetent councilmen do their jobs, so there must be more to the situation.

Also when Ron punches Jamm at Leslie and Ben's wedding, he goes to jail. Is he not punished for this (and for the public intoxication)? Before this, Councilman Howser sees Jamm acting drunk and stupid and he does nothing. All of this baffles me. ",PandR,1387952533,[deleted],1,0,True,2013-12-25

"Who else finds it remarkable that Parks &amp; Rec has remained so consistently fantastic, considering that it's now approaching its SIXTH season?","Sure, ""Parks"" has received its share of accolades &amp; acclaim over the years, but it seems like most people fail to realize just how *rare* it is for a sitcom to churn out five seasons without showing any signs of fatigue or staleness. 

This is obvious just by looking at Parks &amp; Rec's neighbors on the NBC comedy block. ""The Office"" for example is likely to go down in history as one of the greatest sitcoms of all-time - and that series began to show signs of rust after just three seasons (largely due to Jim &amp; Pam finally getting together).

Then you have a show like ""Community"", with its insanely passionate fanbase and its street cred as Arrested Development 2.0 -- ""the thinking man's sitcom."" Yet as much as I love that show, it began to lose its touch in Season 3 and the magic was effectively gone once Dan Harmon was booted.

""Parks"" on the the other hand, has managed to avoid any such dips in quality - despite being dealt its fair share of adversity (constantly sitting on the cancellation bubble, series-regular Paul Schneider quitting the show, etc). The writers have somehow managed to keep things interesting and fresh. Even the romances on the show have remained interesting &amp; adorable, well past the will they-won't they stages. 

When it's all said and done (and barring a majorly disappointing Season 6) could this show be considered one of the greatest sitcoms of its time? I believe this is a distinct possibility.",PandR,1372902246,[deleted],35,176,True,2013-07-03

The Weekend Update Legacy,"With Brad Hall's guest appearance on PandR, this represents two generations of Weekend Update anchors appearing together. Hall, you may remember, anchored ""Saturday Night News,"" in 1982-1983. Amy Poehler, of course, sat at the Weekend Update desk from 2004-2008.

Add to this Tina Fey's and Jimmy Fallon's shows also airing that night, and it's quite the pedigree. It's a shame Community wasn't on (the less said about the Chevy Chase situation, the better).

Consider still, if somehow 3rd Rock from the Sun, costarring Jane Curtin, were still on the air... But let's not go down that rabbit hole.

Why are Leslie and Anne so close,"So I'm in college right now, and its becoming readily apparent that the friends you meet early on in your socialization tend to form your steady social group and it becomes more difficult to expand upon this group later on.

DAE feel like this is the last season?,"Based on what all is happening this season, I really don't see how they could stretch the show out any further. Look at everyone's storylines:

Leslie/Ben: That proposal happened super early, giving enough time for a end of season wedding.

Lot 48: Starting to look like that will happen this season as well, wrapping up the initial storyline of the show.

Tom: Finally matured and starting what appears to be a successful business.

Andy: On his way to finally becoming a cop.

Ron: Finally looks to have a sane woman to settle down with.

Assuming all of this stuff happens, what else is left for the show to do? Leslie will be married and has reached her goal of public office. The park will be built, Tom will be done with P&amp;R and fully in his own business, and Andy will finally be a cop.

I suppose they could create new storylines, but this show has already hit it's peak IMO and any other seasons after this I feel would really start to decline in quality, as happens in most shows that hang on for too long.

I know most people want to see the show go on for a while, but I would rather this be the last season and everything tie up nicely than them start grasping for ideas and the show slowly spiral in to a steaming pile of crap.

Anyone else disappointed with the latest episode Pawnee Commons?,"Everything was so cliche. The bit where Leslie couldn't apologize is a weak joke done in every show ever made. I was practically cringing at that part. Andy was obviously going to do a great job at being a security guard after he explained how much he hated it, which made that entire story line predictable, although it was probably the best part of the episode. Ben and Leslie's story line was just as predictable. Obviously Leslie was going to be right about Eagleton being rude, and obviously Eagleton was going to give a cliche representation of how fat Pawnee is with their park plan. Tom's story line was pretty well done though. Also, Leslie...I don't know what it is, but she's changed, and she doesn't act at all like last season...and she looks about 10 years younger.

Also, Mark Brandanaquits left Leslie plans for a park. That would have been so perfect to have an episode with him, or even just mentioning his name would've been cool. But apparently they needed this random Eagleton guy, instead of one of Leslie's close old friends, and a great character. 

It just didn't have that awkward funny flow of the Parks and Rec I know and love.

Ron Swanson is a terrible investor,"In S5:E6, Ron mentions that he has a bunch of money to invest in Tom's business ideas because he's put all his money in gold since he was 9.

The director of the department of public works of Indianapolis (a city significantly larger than the 80k residents of Pawnee) makes $90k, with the median employee making roughly $50k. [1]

If we assume Ron Swanson to be roughly the same age as Nick Offerman (42) [2], he would have started working and investing in 1979, with a career of 33 years. If we assume a linear growth in his salary from the median salary to the director's salary (a generous assumption),  a real return on gold of 1.75% (the average from 1975-2010 [3]), and a savings rate of 10% (compared to the national average of less than 5%), he invested a total of $119k over the course of his career, and wound up with **a whopping $156,120**.

Parks and Recreation has...literally...ruined every other comedy for my wife and I.,"We started watching P and R about 2 weeks ago on Netflix. We finished season 4 yesterday afternoon. My wife was almost in tears at the end of the last episode because, well, it was over (until season 5 starts). This has been the single most hilarious and enjoyable series I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. We're attached to all the characters, and every single episode is amazing. Having said that, however, we cannot enjoy any other comedy series or movie it turns out. We resumed How I Met Your Mother, but the laugh track kills it for me now and the humour isn't anywhere near as brilliant as P and R. The Office? Nope. 30 Rock?

A wee bit o' character discussion during the off-season.,"This is one of my favorite subs, most likely due to the good nature of it's members but also definitely aided by the plain awesomeness of the show.

In light of that, I was hoping to discuss an observation that I've fully realized after watching season 4 twice through. Is anyone else genuinely annoyed by Kathryn Hahn's Jennifer Barkley character? Even taking into account that she's supposed to be like that, are you still just irked by her presence on the screen? While I realize that it's not entirely her (Hahn's) fault due to not having as much input as others did when it came to the development of her character, I can't help but feel that she was too similar to the character she played in ""The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard."" Besides being a repeat part, I felt that her character was too dominating on the screen in Parks and Rec because it detracted from the main characters (Ben, Leslie) being able to do what people love them for. Barkley's snide and apathetic attitude towards her opponent's struggle just became a tired and irritating joke after a while for me.

It would be a lovely storyline if April, say, didn't have a father, but they seem to be ignoring the fact that her real dad exists and appears to be a good father(we haven't seen any evidence to the contrary).",PandR,1326569668,Sheikia,2,3,True,2012-01-14

"S04E12 - ""Campaign Ad"" - Discussion Thread (SPOILERS)","The list of ""other things Leslie is pro"" (posted elsewhere in the subreddit) is pretty hilarious.

Paul Rudd was great as Bobby Newport. Not evil, just entitled.

Leslie's flying tackle was awesome.

Andy + April = still awesome, though the subplot seemed a bit disconnected from the rest of the plot (though, well, that's how those two are generally). By itself, however, Andy's ability to injure himself is hilariously impressive.

The return of the christmas presents! (Ron's door-closer and Andy's gold record.)

The Ron-Chris subplot was entertaining but not continuously so, and it only really got interesting at the end. I wonder how it'll play out... [Alan Sepinwall](http://www.hitfix.com/blogs/whats-alan-watching/posts/parks-and-recreation-campaign-ad-pros-and-cons) predicts what sort of dynamic would result if Ron took the job (and Leslie lost).

The ad they settled on in the end still seemed about as negative (well, slightly less so because it was balanced with the positive) as Ben's original... But I guess it's more of a balance between Ben and Leslie than the original.

[Some other great moments](http://parksandrecfans.com/2012/01/20/quotes-from-episode-4-12-campaign-ad/):

* ""Bobby."" ""*Bobby!*"" ""**NEWPORT.**""

* The immediate cut from Ron declining Chris' invitation to him having lunch with Chris, leaving us wondering the same as Ron.

* ""We're smart."" (*Andy hits himself in the face with the ball he threw against the wall.*)

* ""Some of those are symptoms, and some of those are being a person.""

* ""Ron Swanson! How are you?"" ""Present.""

* ""Hi, I‚Äôm Bobby Newport. I‚Äôm a regular guy. I like dogs. I‚Äôm here with my Persian greyhound Reclette, who was given to me by the pretender to the crown of Alsace-Lorraine.""

* ""E, H, 4, M, potato shape, coffee mug shape, smudge, smudge, middle finger, smudge, the rest are all smudges."" ""Oh my god, you drove us here.""

* The entire sequence of Andy mis-describing all the medical procedures he had done... And the apparently less medical one.

* ""We‚Äôre not gonna quit the campaign. Why would we do that?"" ""Because I want it. Come on, give me it. Give me it. Gimme it. C‚Äômon, gimme it. Just gimme the election! I‚Äôm sorry, please. Please.""

"Remember my ""Long Live Zorp"" poster? Here it is. For free.","About a month ago I posted a [photo of a poster I made for my sister](http://www.reddit.com/r/PandR/comments/nqm3x/i_made_this_for_my_sister_for_christmas/). A lot of you guys really liked it and said that if I got prints made you'd buy them.

I looked into getting a run of 50 or so made and selling them on an etsy store, but that would require me to pay for all 50 posters up front and hope they sold. I'm in college right now, and I've been putting all of my disposable income to my thesis film, so that option wasn't really feasible. 

So I'm just going to give it to you for free.

You can find a high-resolution pdf of the poster [here](http://www.mediafire.com/?5co5x5e889k272u). If you take it to your local print shop, or send it to an online service like [psprint](http://www.psprint.com) you will be able to get it printed on whatever paper you wish. (The final poster dimensions are 28x22)

Since so many of you were kind enough to offer to pay me for this, I will go ahead and [put up this paypal donations link](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&amp;business=P2Q8TMNXJPMMY&amp;lc=US&amp;item_name=Zorp%20poster&amp;currency_code=USD&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donate_SM%2egif%3aNonHosted) so you can pay whatever you think it's worth. You're free to pay nothing, but whatever you can give would be greatly appreciated, and will help me send my short film out to festivals.

Rashida Jones' 'new' role in the show,"It seems like they are giving Ann a lot more comedic lines and 'forcing' her to have more on-screen time with the rest of the cast (whereas she was with Leslie most of the time).

I think this is working out fantastically! Ann was always the 'outsider' that didn't feel (to me) like she had a lot of chemistry with the rest of the cast.

In season 4 this has drastically changed. I loved her bit with April and Ron where she set out to have a casual and **amicable** small talk with them.

"After discovering Parks And Recreation two weeks ago, I have seen every episode...","It's easily my second favourite comedy from Americah. It'll be almost impossible to beat AD but goddamn do I love Parks.

The first season almost threw me off entirely, besides a few decent lines, it just wasn't that funny. A few episodes into season 2 and the show became a different beast entirely, and so much funnier. I was a little anxious that season 3 would see a dip in quality, and to my delight it's still going strong.

It has a sweetness to it that's really appealing and yet not overly sentimental, which is the case for a lot of other American sitcoms.

Anyway..., there isn't much point to this post except to profess my love for Pawnee's P&amp;R department, they fucking rock.",PandR,1305298520,aestus,27,46,True,2011-05-13

And we're done! What are some of your favourite moments/scenes/jokes from season 3?,"Here are my five favourite scenes:

-The stinger in ""Media Blitz,"" where Leslie and Tom applaud Ben's meltdown while he takes a bow

-Natalie's wedding speech in ""Fancy Party"" and April's reaction to it

-Leslie and Ann's argument shot from outside a bar bathroom in ""The Fight""

-The cold open to ""The Bubble,"" where Ann's office is full of balloons

-The wide shots of all of Pawnee present at the memorial service in ""Li'l Sebastian""


And it wasn't the best gag, but for some reason the biggest laugh of the season for me was the way Perd Hapley introduced Ya Herd: ""Today's show begins... now.""

And finally, though I think ""Media Blitz"" was my favourite episode overall, ""Fancy Party"" gave me more sheer joy than anything else I've seen this year.",PandR,1305911655,hellohelicopter,27,15,True,2011-05-20
